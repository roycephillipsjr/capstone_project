Say hey! It's Prince Ali

Hey! Clear the way in the old Bazaar
Hey you!
Let us through!
It's a bright new star!
Oh Come!
Be the first on your block to meet his eye!

Make way!
Here he comes!
Ring bells! Bang the drums!
Are you gonna love this guy!

Prince Ali! Fabulous he!
Ali Ababwa
Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee!
Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your sunday salaam
The come and meet his spectacular corterie

Prince Ali!
Mighty is he!
Ali Ababwa
Strong as ten regular men, definitely!
He faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali

He's got seventy-five golden camels
(don't they look lovely june)
Purple peacocks
He's got fifty-three
(fabulous harry, I love the feathers)
When it comes to exotic-type mammals
Has he got a zoo?
I'm telling you, it's a world-class menagerie

Prince Ali! Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa
That physique! How can I speak
Weak at the knee
Well, get on out in that square
Adjust your vein and prepare
To gawk and gravel and stare at Prince Ali!

There's no question this Ali's alluring
Never ordinary, never boring
Everything about the man just plain impresses
He's a winner, he's a whiz, a wonder!
He's about to pull my heart asunder!
And I absolutely love the way he dresses!

He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys
(He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys)
And to view them he charges no fee
(He's generous, so generous)
He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies
(Proud to work for him)
They bow to his whim love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali!

Prince Ali!
Amorous he! Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see
And that, good people, is why he got dolled up and dropped by
With sixty elephants, llamas galore
With his bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key

Aladdin,Are You In Or Out? Lyrics,"
                    Sa'luk:
I remember a time
When crime was sublime
There was plenty of loot in the lair
We'd plunder and pillage
And ransack a village
With nary a worry or care
Then along came this king
With his soft-hearted dream
But he ratted us out in the end
So rally the troops!
We were meant to re-group
And return to our roots once again!
Are you in or out?
Gotta know without a doubt
I'm the one you need for a dirty deed
I'm the best, success is guaranteed
Are you men or mice?
Take a slice of my advice!
You want a fearless leader, one that's strong and stout
Better vote for me
Are you in or out?

Thives:
We used to be smart, yes
Horrendously heartless
In ravaging raids, we were rough
We knew what we had
To be blissfully bad
Then Cassim brought this sensitive stuff!
And we strayed from the path
Of our rigorous wrath
Now we're taking a bath in the dust!
But we'll reclaim our winnings
Our humble beginnings
In turmoil and torture, we trust!

Sa'luk:
Are you in or out?
Double-crossers or devout?
Put your faith in me
Pretty soon you'll see
I'm the prince of generosity
Are you foe or friend?
Here's the path I recommend
You want a ride to fame?
I've got the fastest route;
What's it gonna be?
Thieves:
We'll go robbing in all the right places,
From Agrabah dunes to Bali
Imagine the fear on their faces
When we drop by for cookies and tea

Sa'luk:
Come along, boys!
Follow me!
Are you in or out?
If you're with me, give a shout (Yay!)
I'll lead you all the way
Into the glory days
We'll begin a life of crime that pays

Thieves:
Are you out or in?
Make your choice now, sink or swim!

Sa'luk:
You can stick with me, or stay behind and pout
What's it gonna be?
Consider carefully
Are you in or out?                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/a/aladdin/ + /a/aladdin/are+you+in+or+out_20643462.html,0,1
Aladdin,Arabian Nights Lyrics,"

Where it's flat and immense

It's barbaric, but hey, it's home

Where the caravan camels roam
Where they cut off your ear
If they don't like your face
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home }

And the sun's from the west
And the sand in the glass is right

Stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night

Like Arabian days
More often than not
Are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways

Aladdin,A Whole New World Lyrics,"
                    I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
Hold your breath - it gets better
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment red-letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place

Your parlor tricks are amusing
I bet you've got a bunny
Under your hat!

To get the best of me,
Hope your hand is hot!
C'mon, clown,
Let's see what you've got!
You can try to slam me
With your hardest stuff
But your double whammy
Isn't up to snuff
I'll set the record straight
You're simply out of date
You're only second rate!
You think your cat's a meanine,
But your tiger's tame
You've got a lot to learn
About the genie game
So for your education,
I'll reiterate
You're only second rate!
Men cower at the power
In my pinky
My thumb is number one
On every list
But if you're not convinced
That I'm invincible,
Put me to the test!
I'd love to lay this rivalry to rest!
Go ahead and zap me
With the big surprise
Snap me in a trap,
Cut me down to size
I'll make a great escape
It's just a piece of cake
You're only second rate!
You know, your hocus-pocus
Isn't tough enough
And your mumbo-jumbo
Doesn't measure up
Let me pontificate
Upon your sorry state
You're only second rate!

Granny's gonna grab ya!

And this thing's bigger than the both of us!
So spare me your tremendous scare!
You look horrendous in your underwear!
And I can hardly wait
To discombobulate

In a shipping crate
You'll make a better living
With a spinning plate

Aladdin,There's A Party Here In Agrabah 1 Lyrics,"
                    There's a party here in Agrabah
There's excitement in the air
People pouring in from near and far
'Cause Jasmine and Aladdin are gonna have a weddin'

There's a party here in Agrabah
Ev'rybody will be there
So if you're a pouper or a shah
Do something wilh your hair!

You mustn't wear an outfit that's naughty
A turban that's unravelling just won't do
No earrings that are taste|ess or gaudy
You're gonna |ook gorgeous when I get through
There's a party here in Agrabah
So I'm goin' to paint the town
If you want to see what colors are
Follow me around

Aladdin's gettin' married
And it's gonna be the wedding of the century
My buddy's gettin' married and you're gonna see
Just how much I can do

You've heard of your Safari Bar Mitzvahs
You've all been to a luau sweetsixteen
Well none of them compare to what this is
The food'll be disgusting, by evening you'll be bursting

There's a party here in Agrabah
And it's got us all aglow
If a street rat could have come so far
Maybe I could do it
Sure, there's nothin' to it

There's a party here in Agrabah
But we're not sure that we'll go
For although the bride is ladidah
The groom is awfully low

Now we take you down to the palace
Where ev'ryone has celebrated all night long
Without Jafar and all of his malice
Ev'rybody is happy! What could possibly go wrong?

There's a party here in Agrabah
And we're gonna rob'em blind
While they're all munching caviar
Create a small disturbance
I'll sneak up flom behind

There's a party here in Agrabah
And the loot is pouring in
I like this wedding stuff so far
Maybe if I'm pleasant I'll get to keep a present

We've ordered just a few tasteful flowers
And valets who will carefully park for you
The brides maids have been dressing for hours
Girls you look just lovely and so grown up too

There's a party here in Agrabah
Guests are filling up the room
But there's something missing, Yes, a-ha!
Where is the groom?                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/a/aladdin/ + /a/aladdin/theres+a+party+here+in+agrabah+1_20643446.html,0,1
Aladdin,Proud Of Your Boy Lyrics,"
                    Proud of your boy
I'll make you proud of your boy
Believe me, bad as I've been, Ma
You're in for a pleasant surprise

I've wasted time
I've wasted me
So say I'm slow for my age
A late bloomer, Okay, I agree

That I've been one rotten kid
Some son, some pride and some joy
But I'll get over these lousin' up
Messin' up, screwin' up times

You'll see, Ma, now comes the better part
Someone's gonna make good
Cross his stupid heart
Make good and finally make you
Proud of your boy

Tell me that I've been a louse and loafer
You won't get a fight here, no ma'am
Say I'm a goldbrick, a goof-off, no good
But that couldn't be all that I am

Water flows under the bridge
Let it pass, let it go
There's no good reason that you should believe me
Not yet, I know, but

Someday and soon
I'll make you proud of your boy
Though I can't make myself taller
Or smatter or handsome or wise

I'll do my best, what else can I do?
Since I wasn't born perfect like Dad or you
Mom, I will try to
Try hard to make you

Aladdin,Nothing Like A Friend Lyrics,"
                    I parachuted down
Into the Taj Mahal
I rollerbladed
Along the great Great Wall!
I even made the famous
Leaning Tower fall,
But who was with me through it all?
Nobody!
The Moscow Circus
Hired me to fly trapeze
On Mount Olympus,
Ran a race with Hercules
It's easy when you're chased by killer bees!
Who said ""geshundheit"" when I sneezed? *Achoo*
So now I'm home,
Home again with you,
You chase the clouds away
Whenever I am blue

Aladdin:
(""You're always blue!"")

And though the pyramids,
I highly recommend
There is nothing in the world
Quite like a friend!
Slept like a babe in Bombay
On a bed of nails
Moroccans love my daring Dance of Seven Veils
Of seven veils
I single-handedly
I even saved the whales!
No one was there to hear my tales!
In Acapulco,
Joined a Mariachi band
I rode the ragin' rapids
Down the Rio Grande
Flew in a air balloon,
But when I tried to land
Nobody laughed,
Or lent a hand
Without you, the Amazon is
Just a trickle
Without you, the Sahara's
Not so hot
Without you, Niagara Falls
Is just a leaky faucet
The Huey ii
Is just some yacht
Now that I'm home,
Home again, it's clear,
All I ever wanted
Seems to be right here
I've traveled East and West
And now, I'm back again
There is nothing in the world
Quite like a friend...

Aladdin:
There's nothing in the world

Jasmine:
Nothing in the whole wide world

There is nothing in the world
Quite like a friend!
Nothing in the whole wide world!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/a/aladdin/ + /a/aladdin/nothing+like+a+friend_20643451.html,0,1

Aladdin,Out Of Thin Air Lyrics,"

You reached out your hand and took me on
A magic carpet ride
One look at your smile
And I could see the light shining ev'rywhere
People like you don't come out of thin air

You don't understand, there is so much that you don't see
Just think if you can what growing up
Had to be like for me
Your father's a man who taught you who you are
Mine was never there
So how can you say I don't come out of thin air?

There's so much I want to know
You've got the chance to learn
If it means I'd have to go
I'll be right here when you return

Our wedding can wait (I love you)
I think it's worth this small delay (Maybe you're right)
And won't it to be great to have your father
See our wedding day?
It isn't too late (I've waited so long to learn the truth)
And now at last we can finally say
Your father is really there
There's so much that we might share
And you'll finally learn you don't come out of thin air                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/a/aladdin/ + /a/aladdin/out+of+thin+air_20759652.html,0,1

Thank you your lucky stars, you're alive
You've got someone special to talk to
A friend that you can trust for life

But those solo days are done
You'll be two of a kind
Spending quality time
Together as father and son

Building model ships
Taking fishing trips
Warking hand in hand
Painting the palace and moving the sand
First ten to go, with your daddy-o
Once you break the ice
You can postulate palernal advice

It's a fine fantobulous future
I see fruitt on the family tree
You'll be great as the grumpy old grand-pa
Bouncing babies on your knee
You can fall asleep on the comfy couch
After playing one on one
Dreaming back to back
That you walloped the Shoq
Together as father and son

Maybe a bumpy ride
We'll make it side by side
Good afternoon, I'll be your travel guide
Moreover, Laddie, Make room for Daddy Gotta
Whole new shoulder to cry on

Take a chance now give it a spin
You've had chums for palin' around with
But you've never had a friend like him

Put your checkered past behind you now
No more living on the run
Face the big bright beautiul future

Forget about the way you fell into his eyes
Forget about his charms
Forget about how his handsomeness alarms
Walking on air's obnoxious
The thrill
The chill
Will make you nauseous
And you'll never get enough
Just forget about love!
Forget about romance
Forget about the way your heart begins to dance
Then you feel the blush
When he's spouting out some sentimental mush
Love really is revolting!
It's even worse than when you're sulking
Enough of this fluff!
Just forget about love!
[Jasmine:] I had almost forgotten the way it felt
When he held out his hand for mine
My heart all a-flutter
[Iago:] Oh, how I shudder
[Jasmine:] It was eternal bliss
[Iago:] It won't be missed!
Forget about 'is touch

It doesn't matter much

When you eat alone

Scheherezade had a thousand tales
But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeves
You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power in your corner now
Some heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how
See all you gotta do is rub that lamp

Mister Aladdin, sir
What will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order
Jot it down
You ain't never had a friend like me

And I'm your maitre d'

You ain't never had a friend like me

The king, the shah
Say what you wish
It's yours! True dish
How about a little more Baklava?

Have some of column ""A""
Try all of column ""B""

Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this out their little hat?
Can your friends go, Woo?
Well, looky here
Can your friends go, Abracadabra, let 'er rip
And then make the sucker disappear?

So doncha sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed
I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
You got me bona fide, certified
You got a genie for your chare d'affaires
I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what-cha wish? I really wanna know
You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt
Well, all you gotta do is rub like so - and oh

Beauty and the Beast,Prologue (The Enchantress) Lyrics,"
                    Once upon a time, in a faraway land,
A young Prince lived in a shining castle.
Although he had everything his heart desired,
The Prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind.
But then, one winter's night,
An old beggar woman came to the castle
And offered him a single rose In return for shelter from the bitter cold.
Repulsed by her haggard appearance,
The Prince sneered at the gift,
And turned the old woman away.
But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances,
For Beauty is found within.
And when he dismissed her again,
The old woman's ugliness melted away
To reveal a beautiful Enchantress.
The Prince tried to apologize, but it was too late,
For she had seen that there was no love in his heart.
And as punishment,
She transformed him into a hideous beast,
And placed a powerful spell on the castle,
And all who lived there.
Ashamed of his monstrous form,
The beast concealed himself inside his castle,
With a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.
The Rose she had offered,
Was truly an enchanted rose,
Which would bloom until his twenty-first year.
If he could learn to love another,
And earn her love in return
By the time the last petal fell,
Then the spell would be broken.
If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast
For all time.
As the years passed,
He fell into despair, and lost all hope,
For who could ever learn to love... A Beast?                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beauty+and+the+beast/ + /b/beauty+and+the+beast/prologue+the+enchantress_20623203.html,0,1

First prize is nearly mine
It's quite my best invention
So simple, yet complex;
So massive, yet so small
This triumph of design

That is, provided I can find the fair at all
I must have missed a sign...
I should have paid attention...

Papa, do you think I'm... Odd?

Maurice

My daughter odd?
Where did you get an idea like that?

Belle

I don't know.
It's just that, well, people talk.

Maurice

They talk about me, too.

Maurice

No, we're not odd, its true
No fam'ly ever saner
Except one uncle who... Well, maybe let that pass
In all you say or do
You couldn't make it plainer
You are your mother's daughter; therefore you are class

Belle

So I should just accept
I'm simply not like them

Maurice

They are the common herd
And you should take my word
You are unique: creme de la creme
No matter what you do
I'm on your side
And if my point of view Is somewhat misty-eyed
There's nothing clearer in my life
Than what I wish and feel for you
And that's a lot...
No matter what

Belle

No matter what they say
You make me proud I love the funny way
You stand out from the crowd

Maurice

It's my intention my invention
Shows the world out there one day
Just what we've got...

Belle

No matter what

Maurice

Now some may say all fathers just exaggerate

Belle

That ev'ry daughter's great?

Maurice

You are!

Belle

And ev'ry daughter tends to say her father's tops

Maurice

She pulls out all the stops
To praise him

Belle

And quite rightly!

Maurice

No matter what the pain
We've come this far I pray that you remain
Exactly as you are
This really is a case of father knowing best

And daughter too!

You've been dreaming, just one dream
Nearly all your life
Hoping, scheming, just one theme:
Will you be a wife?
Will you be some he-man's property?
Good news!
That he-man's me!
This equation, girl plus man
Doesn't help just you
On occasion, women can
Have their uses too
Mainly to extend the fam'ly tree
Pumpkin, extend with me!

Gaston

We'll be raising sons galore

Belle

Inconceivable!

Gaston

Each built six foot four!

Belle

Unbelievable!

Gaston

Each stuffed with ev'ry Gaston gene!

Gaston

Oh so gratified

So unweddable!

Gaston

That you are a part of this idyllic scene.

Ones play on the floor with the dogs. We'll have six or seven!

Belle

Dogs?

Gaston

No, Belle!

Strapping boys... Like me!

Belle

Imagine that!

Gaston

I can see that we will share
All that love implies
We shall be a perfect pair
Rather like my thighs
You are face to face with destiny!
All roads lead to...
The best things in life are...
All's well that ends with me!
Escape me?
There's no way

Beauty and the Beast,The Mob Song Lyrics,"
                    [Gaston:]       The Beast will make off with your children.
[Mob:]          {gasp}
[Gaston:]       He'll come after them in the night.
[Belle:]        No!
[Gaston:]       We're not safe till his head is mounted on my wall! I
Say we kill the Beast!
[Mob:]          Kill him!

[Man I:]        We're not safe until he's dead
[Man ii:]       He'll come stalking us at night
[Woman:]        Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
[Man iii:]      He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free
[Gaston:]       So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me

Through the mist
Through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer
Then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast
He's got fangs
Razor sharp ones
Massive paws
Killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar
See him foam
But we're not coming home
'Til he's dead
Good and dead
Kill the Beast!

[Belle:]        No! I won't let you do this!
[Gaston:]       If you're not with us, you're against us!
Bring the old man!
[Maurice:]      Get your hands off me!
[Gaston:]       We can't have them running off to warn the creature.
[Belle:]        Let us out!
[Gaston:]       We'll rid the village of this Beast. Who's with me?
[Mob:]          I am! I am! I am!)

Light your torch
Mount your horse
[Gaston:]       screw your courage to the sticking place
[Mob:]          We're counting on Gaston to lead the way
Through a mist
Through a wood
Where within a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see ev'ry day
It's a beast
One as tall as a mountain
We won't rest
'Til he's good and deceased
Sally forth
Tally ho
Grab your sword
Grab your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go!

[Gaston:]       We'll lay siege to the castle and bring back his head!
[Belle:]        I have to warn the Beast! This is all my fault! Oh, Papa,
What are we going to do?
[Maurice:]      Now, now, we'll think of something.

[Mob:]          We don't like
What we don't understand
In fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns
Bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the Beast!

[Cogsworth:]    I knew it! I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up.
[Lumiere:]      Maybe it would have been better if she had never come at all.
Could it be?
[Mrs Potts:]    Is it she?
[Lumiere:]      Sacre Bleu! Invaders!
[Cogsworth:]    Encroachers!
[Mrs Potts:]    And they have the mirror!
[Cogsworth:]    Warn the Master! If it's a fight they want, we'll be
Ready for them! Who's with me?
[Gaston:]       Take whatever booty you can find. But remember, the
Beast is mine!

[Objects:]      Hearts ablaze
Banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger just increased
[Mob:]          Raise the flag
Sing the song
Here we come, we're fifty strong
And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong
Let's kill the Beast!

[Mrs Potts:]    Pardon me, Master.
[Beast:]        Leave me in peace.
[Mrs Potts:]    But sir! The castle is under attack!

[Beast:]        It doesn't matter now. Just let them come.

And almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear
And so I'm sure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No it can't be
I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before

Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see

For papa I will stay
But I don't deserve to lose my freedom in this way

Well then... you're a fool
Think again

Is this home?
Is this where I should learn to be happy?
Never dreamed
That a home could be
Dark and cold I was told
Every day in my childhood
Even when we grow old
Home will be where the heart is
Never were words so true
My heart's far, far away
Home is too.

Is this home?
Is this what I must learn to believe in?
Try to find something good
In this tragic place
Just in case
I should stay here forever
Held in this empty space
Oh, but that won't be easy
I know the reason why
My heart's far, far away
Home's a lie
What I'd give
To return
To the life that I knew lately
But I know that I can't
Solve my problems going back

Is this home?
Am I here for a day or forever?
Shut away from the world until
Who knows when
Oh but then
As my life has been altered once it can change again
Build higher walls around me
Change every lock and key
Nothing lasts, nothing holds all of me

My heart's far, far away

No one plots like Gaston,
Takes cheap shots like Gaston,
Plans to persecute harmless crackpots like Gaston.

Is he gone?
Oh, can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.
Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless. ..

""Madame Gaston!""
Can't you just see it?
""Madame Gaston!""
His ""little wife"", ugh!
No sir! Not me! I guarantee it!
I want much more than this provincial life!
I want adventure in the great wide somewhere
I want it more than I can tell
And for once it might be grand
To have someone understand
I want so much more than they've got planned                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beauty+and+the+beast/ + /b/beauty+and+the+beast/belle+reprise_20543488.html,0,1

Little town It's a quiet village
Ev'ry day
Like the one before
Little town
Full of little people
Waking up to say:

TOWNSFOLK

Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!

BELLE

There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Ev'ry morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town

BAKER

Good Morning, Belle!

BELLE

Good morning, Monsieur.

BAKER

And where are you off to, today?

BELLE

The bookshop.
I just finished the most wonderful story
About a beanstalk and an ogre and a -

BAKER

That's nice. Marie!
The baguettes!
Hurry up!

TOWNSFOLK

Look there she goes that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

WOMAN

Never part of any crowd

MAN

'Cause her head's up on some cloud

TOWNSFOLK

No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

Ah, Belle.

BELLE

Good morning, sir.
I've come to return the book I borrowed.

BOOKSELLER

Finished already?

BELLE

Oh, I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new?

BOOKSELLER

Not since yesterday.

BELLE

That's all right.
I'll borrow . . . . . this one!

BOOKSELLER

That one?
But you've read it twice!

BELLE

Well, it's my favorite!
Far off places, daring swordfights, magic spells, a prince in disguise -

BOOKSELLER

If you like it all that much, it's yours!

BELLE

But sir!

BOOKSELLER

I insist.

BELLE

Thank you.
Thank you very much!

TOWNSFOLK

Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

BELLE

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my fav'rite part because --- you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

WOMAN

Now it's no wonder that her name means ""Beauty""
Her looks have got no parallel

SHOPKEEPER

But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd

MAN

Very diff'rent from the rest of us

TOWNSFOLK

She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle!

I got it Gaston!
Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston!
You're the greatest hunter in the whole world!

GASTON

I know.

No beast alive stands a chance against you. ---
And no girl, for that matter.

GASTON

It's true, LeFou.
And I've got my sights set on that one.

LEFOU

The inventor's daughter?

GASTON

She's the one - the lucky girl I'm going to marry.

LEFOU

But she's -

GASTON

The most beautiful girl in town.

LEFOU

I know, but -

GASTON

That makes her the best.
And don't I deserve the best?

LEFOU

Of course you do!

GASTON

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

BIMBETTES

Look there he goes Isn't he dreamy?

Be still my heart I'm hardly breathing

Ma chere, Mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight.
And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents - your dinner!

Be our guest! Be our guest!
Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie
And we'll provide the rest
Soup du jour
Hot hors d'oeuvres
Why, we only live to serve
Try the gray stuff
It's delicious!

Don't believe me? Ask the dishes!
They can sing, they can dance
After all, Miss, this is France
And a dinner here is never second best
Go on, unfold your menu
Take a glance and then you'll
Be our guest
Oui, our guest
Be our guest!

LUMIERE AND CHORUS

Beef ragout
Cheese souffle
Pie and pudding ""en flambe""

LUMIERE

We'll prepare and serve with flair
A culinary cabaret!
You're alone
And you're scared
But the banquet's all prepared
No one's gloomy or complaining
While the flatware's entertaining
We tell jokes!
I do tricks
With my fellow candlesticks

CHORUS

And it's all in perfect taste
That you can bet
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass
To be out guest

It's fine dining we suggest

CHORUS

Be our guest! Be our guest! Be our guest!

Life it so unnerving
For a servant who's not serving
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon
Ahh those good ol' days when we were useful
Suddenly those good ol' days are gone
10 years we've been rusting
Needing so much more than dusting
Needing exercise, a chance to use our skill
Most days we just lay around the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy you walked in and oopsie daisy

MRS. POTTS

It's a guest! It's a guest!
Sakes alive, well I'll be blessed!
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed
With dessert, she'll want tea
And my dear that's fine with me
While the cups do their soft-shoein'
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing
I'll get warm, piping hot
Heaven's sakes! Is that a spot?
Clean it up! We want the company impressed

CHORUS

We've got a lot to do!

MRS. POTTS

Is it one lump or two?
For you, our guest!

And we're obsessed
With your meal, with your ease
Yes, indeed, we aim to please
While the candlelight's still glowing
Let us help you,
We'll keep going
Course by course, one by one
'Til you shout, ""Enough! I'm done!""
Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up

Beauty and the Beast,As Long As There's Christmas Lyrics,"
                    Don't look inside a stocking
Don't look under the tree
The one thing we're looking for
Is something we can't see
Far more precious than silver
And more splendid than gold
Is something to treasure
But is something we can't hold

As long as there's Christmas
I truly believe
That hope is the greatest of the gifts
We'll receive (we'll receive)

As we all pray together
It's the time to rejoice
And though we may look different
We are singing with one voice

As Long As there's Christmas
I truly believe
That hope is the greatest of the gifts
We'll recieve

There is more (so much more)
To this time of year (to this time of year)
Than sleigh bells and holly
Mistletoes and snow
Those things will come and go
Come and goooo

As long as there is Christmas
I truly do believe that
Hope is the greatest of the gifts
We will receive (we'll receive)

As Long As there's Christmas
I truly believe (I truly believe)
That hope is the greatest of the gifts
We'll recieve

If I could give a gift to you
To hold to your heart dear
I'd give the Christmas memories
To hold throughout the year.

And when you have them all, I think
There's something more I'd bring
The gift of Christmas laughter now
So you could learn to sing...

La la la la, it's Christmas time
Memories everywhere
Singing of hope, peace to mankind
And love is in the air.

And every foolish notion leads to feelings that might start
To make the prayers the children pray
Come true in all our hearts...

Beast:
If you could give a gift to me
To hold to my soul dear
I'd love to see you smile upon my face,
Without a fear

And when you've smiled your fear away
There's something more you'd bring
The gift of gifts, remembering
How I first learned to sing...

Both:
La la la la, it's Christmas time
Memories everywhere
Singing of hope, peace to mankind

Beast:
And in my twisted face
There's not the slightest trace
Of anything that even hints of kindness
And from my tortured shape
No comfort, no escape
I see, but deep within is utter blindness

Hopeless
As my dream dies
As the time flies
Love a lost illusion
Helpless
Unforgiven
Cold and driven
To this sad conclusion

No beauty could move me
No goodness improve me
No power on earth, if I can't love her
No passion could reach me
No lesson could teach me
How I could have loved her and make her love me too
If I can't love her, then who?

Long ago I should have seen
All the things I could have been
Careless and unthinking, I moved onward

No pain could be deeper
No life could be cheaper
No point anymore, if I can't love her
No spirit could win me
No hope left within me
Hope I could have loved her and that she'd set me free
But it's not to be
If I can't love her
Let the world be done with me.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beauty+and+the+beast/ + /b/beauty+and+the+beast/if+i+cant+love+her_20599831.html,0,1

Who does she think she is?
That girl has tangled with the wrong man!

Darn right.

No one says ""no"" to Gaston!
Dismissed! Rejected!
Publicly humiliated!
Why, it's more than I can bear.

Lefou

More beer?

Gaston

What for? Nothing helps.
I'm disgraced.

Lefou

Who, you? Never!
Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.

Lefou

Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston
Looking so down in the dumps
Ev'ry guy here'd love to be you, Gaston
Even when taking your lumps
There's no man in town as admired as you
You're ev'ryone's favorite guy
Ev'ryone's awed and inspired by you
And it's not very hard to see why

No one's slick as Gaston
No one's quick as Gaston
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston's
For there's no man in town half as manly
Perfect, a pure paragon!
You can ask any Tom, dick or Stanley
And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on

Lefou and chorus

No one's been like Gaston
A king pin like Gaston

Lefou

No one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston

Gaston

As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating!

Give five ""hurrahs!"" Give twelve ""hip-hips!""

Gaston is the best
And the rest is all drips

Chorus

No one fights like Gaston
Douses lights like Gaston

Lefou

In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston!

Bimbettes

For there's no one as burly and brawny

Gaston

As you see I've got biceps to spare

Lefou

Not a bit of him's scraggly or scrawny

Gaston

That's right!
And ev'ry last inch of me's covered with hair

Chorus

No one hits like Gaston
Matches wits like Gaston

Lefou

In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston

Gaston

I'm espcially good at expectorating!
Ptoooie!

Chorus

Ten points for Gaston!

Gaston

When I was a lad
I ate four dozen eggs
Ev'ry morning to help me get large
And now that I'm grown
I eat five dozen eggs
So I'm roughly the size of a barge!

Chorus

Oh, ahhh, wow!
My what a guy, that Gaston!
No one shoots like Gaston
Makes those beauts like Gaston

Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston

Gaston

I use antlers in all of my decorating!

I love Paris in the fall.
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles,
I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles.

Cole Porter,I'm A Gigolo Lyrics,"
                    I should like you all to know,
I'm a famous gigolo.
And of lavender, my nature's got just a dash in it.
As I'm slightly undersexed,
You will always find me next
To some dowager who's wealthy rather than passionate.
Go to one of those night club places
And you'll find me stretching my braces
Pushing ladies with lifted faces 'round the floor.
But I must confess to you
There are moments when I'm blue.
And I ask myself whatever I do it for.

I'm a flower that blooms in the winter,
Sinking deeper and deeper in snow.
I'm a baby who has
No mother but jazz,
I'm a gigolo.
Ev'ry morning, when labor is over,
To my sweet-scented lodgings I go,
Take the glass from the shelf
And look at myself,
I'm a gigolo.
I get stocks and bonds
From faded blondes
Ev'ry twenty-fifth of December.
Still I'm just a pet
That men forget
And only tailors remember.
Yet when I see the way all the ladies
Treat their husbands who put up the dough,
You cannot think me odd
If then I thank God
I'm a gigolo.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter//c/cole+porter/im+a+gigolo_21149667.html,1,0

The moon so long has been gazing down
On the warward ways of this wayward town
Her smile becomes a smirk, I go to work

Love that's only slightly soiled

Who would like to sample my supply
Who's prepared to pay the price
For a trip to paradise

In their childish ways
I know every type of love
Better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
I've been through the mill of love
Old love

Cole Porter,Let's Do It Lyrics,"
                    When the little bluebird
Who has never said a word
Starts to sing Spring
When the little bluebell
At the bottom of the dell
Starts to ring Ding dong Ding dong
When the little blue clerk
In the middle of his work
Starts a tune to the moon up above
It is nature that is all
Simply telling us to fall in love

And that's why birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Cold Cape Cod clams, 'gainst their wish, do it
Even lazy jellyfish do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

I've heard that lizards and frogs do it
Layin' on a rock
They say that roosters do it
With a doodle and c***

Some Argentines, without means do it
I hear even Boston beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

When the little bluebird
Who has never said a word
Starts to sing Spring spring spring
When the little bluebell
At the bottom of the dell
Starts to ring Ding ding ding
When the little blue clerk
In the middle of his work
Starts a tune

The most refined lady bugs do it
When a gentleman calls
Moths in your rugs they do it
What's the use of moth balls

The chimpanzees in the zoos do it,
Some courageous kangaroos do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

I'm sure sometimes on the sly you do it
Maybe even you and I might do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter//c/cole+porter/lets+do+it_20640263.html,1,0

About you, child,
That's so contagious,
Let's be outrageous,

For teasin',
He didn't care about
Those apples out of season!

Means just one thing
To little lovebirds;
We're not above birds,

And only meet

Cole Porter,I Hate Men Lyrics,"
                    I hate men.
I can't abide them even now and then.
Then ever marry one of them, I'd rest a maiden rather,
For husbands are a boring lot that only give you bother.
Of course, I'm awful glad that mother had to marry father,
Still, I hate men.
Of all the types of men I've met in our democracy,
I hate the most the athlete with his manner bold and brassy.
He may have hair upon his chesst, but sister, so has Lassie!
Oh, I hate men!
I hate men.
There worth upon this earth I can not tend
Avoid the traffic sales men atempting Tom he maybe
From China he will bring you jade and perfume from Arabi
But don't forget tis he wholl have the fun and be the baby
Oh I Hate men
If thou shouldst wed a business man, be wary, oh be wary:
He'll tell you he's detained in town on business neccesary.
The business is the business that he gives his secretary!
Oh, I hate men!
I hate men.
Though roosters they, I will not play the hen.
If you espouse an older man through girlish optimism,
He'll always stay at home and night and make no criticism.
Though you may call it love, the doctors call it rheumatism.
Oh, I hate men!
Of all I've read, alone in bed, from A to Zed about 'em,
Since love is blind, then from the mind, all womankind should rout 'em.
But, ladies, you must answer too, what would we do without 'em?

But last evening down in Lover's Lane she strayed.
Madam.
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.

When she woke up and found, that her dream of love was gone.
Madam.
She ran to the man who had lead her so far astray.
And from under a velvet gown,
She drew a gun and shot her lover down,
Madam.

When the mob came and got her and dragged her from the jail,
Madam,
They strung her from the old willow cross the way.
And the moment before she died,
She lifted up her lovely head and cried,
Madam.

Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Wheather near to me or far it's no matter darling

Follows where ever I go
In the roaring trffics boom, in the silence of my lonely room

Under the hyde of me, theres an oh such a hungry yearning

Cole Porter,You're The Top Lyrics,"
                    At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed,
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty
At least it'll tell you
How great you are.

You're the top!
You're the Coliseum.
You're the top!
You're the Louver Museum.
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss
You're a Bendel bonnet,
A Shakespeare's sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile,
You're the Tower of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic.
On the other hand, babe, you shine,
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine
Down my spine.
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans
Might think that your song is bad,
But I got a notion
I'll second the motion
And this is what I'm going to add;

You're the top!
You're Mahatma Gandhi.
You're the top!
You're Napoleon Brandy.
You're the purple light
Of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gallery
You're Garbo's salary,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime,
You're turkey dinner,
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop
But if, baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top!
You're an arrow collar
You're the top!
You're a Coolidge dollar,
You're the nimble tread
Of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama,

You're Whistler's mama!

You're camembert.

You're a rose,
You're Inferno's Dante,

You're the nose
On the great Durante.
I'm just in a way,
As the French would say, ""de trop"".
But if, baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top!
You're a dance in Bali.
You're the top!
You're a hot tamale.
You're an angel, you,
Simply too, too, too diveen,
You're a Boticcelli,
You're Keats,
You're Shelly!

You're Ovaltine!
You're a boom,
You're the dam at Boulder,
You're the moon,
Over Mae West's shoulder,
I'm the nominee of the G. O. P.

Or gop!

But if, baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top!
You're a Waldorf salad.
You're the top!
You're a Berlin ballad.
You're the boats that glide
On the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're an old Dutch master,

You're Lady Astor,
You're broccoli!
You're romance,
You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants, on a Roxy usher,
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,

But if, baby, I'm the bottom,

How aware of my dear departed past am I
Where is the life that late I led?
Where is it now? Totally dead!

But raising an heir could never compare
With raising a bit of hell

In dear Milano, where are you Momo?
Still selling those pictures of the scriptures in the duomo
And Carolina, where are you, 'lina?
Still peddling your pizza in the streets-a Toremina
And in Firenze, where are you Alice?
Still there in your pretty itty-bitty pity palace
And sweet Lucretia, so young and gay
What scandalous doings in the ruins of Pompeii
Where is the life that late I led?
Where is it now? Totally dead!
Where is the fun I used to find?
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!

Yes during the day it's easy to play
But oh what a bore at night

Could still she be cruising that amusing Pontevecchio?
Where is Fedora, the wild virago?

Where is Venetia, who loved to chat so?
Could still she be drinking in her stinking pink palazzo?
And lovely Lisa, where are you Lisa?
You gave a new meaning to the Leaning Tower of Piza
Where is the life that late I led?
Where is it now? Totally dead!
Where is the fun I used to find?
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!

With only a shrew to kiss?

Whenever the blues become my only songs
I concentrate on you

On your smile, so sweet, so tender

When at first my kiss you do decline
On the light in your eyes when you surrender
And once again our arms intertwine

And so when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true
To prove that even the wise men can be wrong

Cole Porter,Begin The Beguine Lyrics,"
                    When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green
I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine
To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part
What moments divine, what rapture serene
The clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean
So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine
O yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more: ""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know what heaven we're in

I'm good by day and I'm good by night
So blow, Gabriel blow.

Once I was headed for hell,
Once I was headed for hell,
But when I got to Satan's door,
I heard you blowin' on your horn once more

Just to fly higher and higher,

And I've been through the fire,
And I've perched my soul,
And my heart too,
So climb up the mountain top and start to

Go on an' blow, Gabriel blow,

                    Now, before this modern idea had burst
About the women and children first,
The men had much more charm than they have today.
And if only one of that type survived,
The very moment that he arrived,
I know I'd fall in love in a great big way.
I can't imagine being bad
With any Arrow collar ad,
Nor could I take the slightest joy
In waking up a college boy.
I've no desire to be alone
With Rudy Vallee's megaphone,
So when I'm saying my prayers, I say:

Find me a primitive man,
Built on a primitive plan.
Someone with vigor and vim.
I don't mean a kind that belongs to a club,
But the kind that has a club that belongs to him.
I could be the personal slave
Of someone just out of a cave.
The only man who'll ever win me
Has gotta wake up the gypsy in me,
Find me a primitive man,
Find me a primitive man.

Trouve moi un homme primitif
Trouve moi un garcon naif.
Quelqu'un tout plein de vigeur,
Ces p'tits maquereaux qu'on appelle gigolos ne
Pourraient jamais donner le vrai bonheur.
J'ai besoin d'un bel animal
Pour chauffeur mon chaffage centrale.
Et l'homme qui me veut pour capitane
Devrait reveiler mon sang tzigane,
Trouve moi un homme primitif, vif,
Trouve moi un homme primitif.

(Find me a primitive man,
Find me a forthright young lad,
Someone with vigor to spare,
Those fatuous beaux they call gigolos could never give me happiness.
I must have a gorgeous beast
To heat up my own central heat.
And he who aspires to be my stud
Must reawake my gypsy blood.
Find me a primitive man.)                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter//c/cole+porter/find+me+a+primitive+man_21150395.html,1,0

How we all enjoy letting loose with a little La-da-dum-dum-dum While we're emptying the vacu-um It's such fun to hum A happy working song Oo-ooh A happy working song Oh, how strange a place to be Till Edward comes for me My heart is sighing Still, as long as I am here I guess a new experience Could be worth trying Hey! Keep drying! You can do a lot when you got Such a happy working tune to hum While you're sponging up the soapy scum We adore each filthy chore That we determine So friends even though you're vermin We're a happy working throng Singing as we fetch the detergent box Or the smelly shirts and the stinky socks Sing along If you cannot sing then hum along As we're finishing our happy working song!

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

And a cosy cottage by the sea?

And invite the Vanderbilts to tea?
Everything on which you've got your heart set
Baby, have a little dream on me

Paris in the Spring, Miami in the Fall
Interviews and pictures in the press
What a way to speak on twenty bucks a week
Don't forget that Rockefeller started out on less

Everything we touch will turn to clover
In the magic land of what's to be
But until your baby puts it over
Baby, have a little dream on me

Yes
Well, all right then

Everything we touch will turn to clover
In the magic land of what's to be
Till your daddy puts it over, skip it

gotta get myself a boutonniere, Lulu's back in town.

You can tell the mailman not to call, I ain't comin' home until the fall

And too much in love to say goodnight

In the cozy chair
Picking on a wishbone
From the Frigidaire
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
And too much in love to break away

Do you remember
The nights we used to linger in the hall?
Father didn't like you at all
Do you remember
The reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest
And get a bit of rest

Drowsy little dame

A dance to do,
Up here in Harlem,
So, everyone start Truckin'.

As soon as the news got 'round,
The folks downtown,
Came up to Harlem,
Saw everbody Truckin'.

It didn't take long
Before the high-hats were doing it,
'Park Avenuing' it,
All over town,
You see them shufflin', shufflin', shufflin' down.

It spread like a forest blaze,
Became a craze,
Thanks to Harlem now,
Everybody's Truckin'.

Fats Waller,Until The Real Thing Comes Along Lyrics,"
                    Until The Real Thing Comes Along
- words and music by Mann Holiner, Alberta Nichols, Sammy Cahn,
Saul Chaplin and L. E. Freeman
- as recorded in New York, August 1, 1936, by Fats Waller & his Rhythm

I'd work for you, I'd even slave for you
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you (whatever that is)
And if that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along

I'd gladly move the earth for you
To prove my love, dear, and it's worth for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do (gotta do)
Until the real thing comes along

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you, darling, come what may
My heart is yours, what more can I say?
(You want me to rob a bank? Well I won't do it)

I'd sigh for you, yes, I'd even cry for you, yes
I'd tear the stars down from the skies for you
If that isn't love, well skip it, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along

Listen baby
I'd even sigh for you, I'm 'bout ready to cry for you
I'd tear the stars down from the skies for you
If that isn't love, it'll have to do, baby, yes
Until the real thing comes along

Fats Waller,Willow Tree Lyrics,"
                    Let me be your weeping willow tree
Surround you with my long limbs
My dear, let me grow in the shade
In the sands by the bank of your river
Let I drink from your streams
The cool breeze fill my leaves

We will sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

I wish I was a weeping willow tree
I wish I was a weeping willow tree

I wish I was a weeping willow tree
Sweet river caress how softly
Stir my searching roots
Shading the sun in the summers heat
Let I cool you
We have been dancing so long
In the winters freeze and the summers drought
We survive
We belong
Let us sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

I wish I was your weeping willow tree
I wish I was a weeping willow tree
I wish I was a weeping willow tree

Let us sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

Let us sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

We can sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

Let me be
Your willow tree
Your willow tree

You'll see tailor-mades and hand-me-downs,
You'll meet honest men, and pick-pockets skilled,
You'll find that business never ceases 'til somebody gets killed!

Married men would have to take their beds and walk,
Except one or two who never drink booze,
And the blind man on the corner singing ""Beale Street Blues!""

I'd rather be there than any place I know,
It's gonna take a sergeant for to make me go!

Fats Waller,Handful Of Keys Lyrics,"
                    I like to tinkle on an old piana
I like to play it in a subtle mannah
I get a lot of pleasure
With a spano' keys
Underneath my finger tips
Tricklin' off o' my lips

A handful of keys
And a song to sing
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive
I repeat what I said before

I like to sing a little tune that's mellah
I like to vocalize
There's nothin' swellah
I love to have a supple melody
Just tricklin' off o' my lips

A handful of keys
And a song to sing
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive
I repeat what I said before

I like to tinkle on an old piana
I like to play it in a subtle mannah
I know I'll always be the top banana

when they see you out with me.

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
and I know the reason why.

You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar,
You just have to touch my cup.
You're my sugar.
It's sweeter when you stir it up.

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
seems the honey fairly drips.

You're my honeysuckle rose

I've been away from you a long time.
I never thought I'd miss you so.
Somehow I feel your love is real
Near you I long to be.
The birds are singin', it is song time
The banjos strummin' soft and low.
I know that you yearn for me too.
Swanee, You're calling me.

Chorus:
Swanee,
How I love ya, how I love ya
My dear old Swanee!
I'd give the world to be
Among the folks in
D-I-X-I-E-ven now my
Mammy's
Waitin' for me, prayin' for me
Down by the Swanee.
The folks up north won't see me no more
When I go to that Swanee Shore!

Swanee, Swanee, I love the old folks at home!

George Gershwin,The Babbitt And The Bromide Lyrics,"
                    A babbitt met a bromide on the avenue one day,
And held a conversation in their own peculiar way;

They both were solid citizens, they both had been around,
And as they spoke you clearly saw their feet were on the ground!

Hello!
How are you?
How's the folks?
What's new?
I'm great!
That's good!
Huh-huh!
Touch wood!
Well well!
what say?
How've you been?
Nice day!
How's things?
What's new?
That's fine!
How are you?


Nice weather we are having, but it gives me such a pain,
I've brought my umbrella so of course it doesn't rain!

Well, hey'ho!
That's life!
What's new?
How's the wife?
Got to run!
Oh my!
Ta-ta!
Olive oil!
Goodbye!

Ten years went quickly by for both these subste-antial men,
And then it happened that one day they chanced to meet again!

That they had both developed in ten years there was no doubt,
And so of course they had an awful lot to talk about!

Hello!
How are you?
How's the folks?
What's new?
I'm great!
That's good!
Huh-huh!
Touch wood!
Well well!
what say?
How've you been?
Nice day!
How's things?
What's new?
That's fine!
How are you?

I seem to know your face but I just can't recall your name!

Well how've you been old boy?  You're looking just about the same!

Well, hey'ho!
That's life!
What's new?
How's the wife?
Got to run!
Oh my!
Ta-ta!
Olive oil!
Goodbye!


Before they met again, some twenty years they had to wait;
This time it happened up above, inside Saint Peter's gate!

A harp each one was carrying, and both were wearing wings,
and this is what they said as they were strumming on the strings;

Hello!
How are you?
How's the folks?
What's new?
Got to run!
Oh my!
Ta-ta!
Olive oil!

George Gershwin,"The Half Of It, Dearie, Blues Lyrics","
                    Each time you trill a song with Bill or look at Will
I get a chill, I'm gloomy
I won't recall the names of all the men who fall
It's all appalling to me
Of course, I really cannot blame them a bit
For you're a hit where're you flit
I know it's so, but dearie, oh!
You'll never know the blues that go right through me
I've got the you-don't-know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues
The trouble is you have so many from whom to choose
If you should marry Tom, Dick, or harry,
Life would be the bunk, I'd become a monk
I've got the you-don't know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues!

To Bill and Ben I'd pay attention now and then
But really men would bore me
When I'd begun to think I'd run and be a nun
I met the one man for me
And now just when the sun is starting to beam
Along comes a girl, zip goes a dream!
What will I do away from you?
I feel the future will be blue and stormy
I've got the you-don't-know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues
It may be my heart isn't broken, but there's a bruise.
Through you I've known some days that were lonesome
Though you say that i'm flirting all the time
I've got the you-don-t know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues!

I've got the you-don't-know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues
Oh, how i wish you'd drop an anchor and end your cruise
You're just a duffer who makes me suffer
All the younger set says your heart's to let

George Gershwin,The Man I Love Lyrics,"
                    When the mellow moon begins to beam,
Ev'ry night I dream a little dream,
And of course Prince Charming is the theme,
The he for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
For/To me it's clear
That he'll appear.
Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong,
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.
He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand ;
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand ;
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not ;
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day
He'll build a little home
Just meant for two,
From which I'll never roam,
Who would - would you ?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/g/george+gershwin/ + /g/george+gershwin/the+man+i+love_20259385.html,1,0

George Gershwin,The Physician Lyrics,"
                    Once I loved such a shattering physician,
Quite the best looking doctor in the state,
He looked after my physical condition
And his bedside manner was great!

When I'd gaze up and see him there above me,
Looking less like a doctor than a Turk,
I was tempted to whisper, ""Do you love me,
Or do you merely love your work?""

He said my bronchial tubes were entrancing,
My epiglottis filled him with glee,
He simply loved my larynx
And went wild about my pharynx,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my epidermis was darling
And found my blood as blue as can be,
He went through wild ecstatics
About my lymphatics,
But he never said he loved me.

And though, no doubt, it was not very smart of me,
I get on a-wracking of my soul,
to figure out why he loved every part of me,
And yet not me as a whole.

By my esophagus he was ravished,
Enthusiastic to a degree,
He said 'twas just enormous,
My appendix vermiformis,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my cerebellum was brilliant,
And my cererum far from N G,
I know he thought a lotta
My medulla oblogota,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my maxillaries were marvels,
And found my sternum stunning to see,
He did a double hurdle
When I shook my pelvic girdle,
But he never said he loved me.

He seemed amused,
When he first made a test of me
To further his medical art;
Yet he refused,
When he's fixed up the rest of me,
To cure that ache in my heart.

I know he thought my pancreas perfect,
And for my spleen was keen as can be,
He said, of all his sweeties,
I'd the sweetest diabetes,
But he never said he loved me.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/g/george+gershwin/ + /g/george+gershwin/the+physician_21362581.html,1,0

The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from Missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from histry I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned
They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly
They told marconi
Wireless was a phony
Its the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune
They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
But ho, ho, ho!
Whos got the last laugh now?
They all laughed at Rockefeller center
Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar
Ford and his misery
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are
They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, ""hello, goodbye.""
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie
They all said wed never get together
Darling, lets take a bow
For ho, ho, ho!

George Gershwin,The Moon Is On The Sea Lyrics,"
                    A woman's touch, a woman's touch
The magic of Aladdin couldn't do as much
She's a wizard, she's a champ
And she doesn't need a lamp

A woman's touch can weave a spell
The kind of hocus pocus that she does so well
With the magic of a broom
She can mesmerize a room

With a whisk whisk here and a whisk whisk there
And a dustpan for the cinders
With a rub rub here and a rub rub there
She can polish up the winders

Then presto chango 
Suddenly, the sun comes shining through
And what does Mr Sunshine say to you?
How d'you do?

It makes you blink, to stop and think
A woman and a whisk-broom 
Can accomplish so darn much
So never under-estimate a woman's touch

A woman's touch can quickly fill
The empty flower boxes on a window sill
One smile from her and zoom
Little buds begin to bloom  

A touch of paint, a magic nail
Can turn a kitchen chair into a Chippendale
Even make the lamp appear
Like a crystal chandelier

With a tack tack here and a tack tack there
And a hand around a hammer
With a mop mop here and a mop mop there
You can give a cabin glamour

Then gosh, almighty, all at once
The cabin that we knew
Becomes a shining castle built for two
Me and you

George Gershwin,Love Walked In Lyrics,"
                    Nothing seemed to matter any more,
Didn't care what I was headed for.
Time was standing still,
No one counted till
There came a knocking at the door.
Love walked right in and drove the shadows away;
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day.
One magic moment, and my heart seemed to know
That love said ""Hello !"",
Though no a word was spoken.
One look and I forgot the gloom of the past;
One look and I had found my future at last.
One look and I had found a world completely new,
When love walked in... With you.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/g/george+gershwin/ + /g/george+gershwin/love+walked+in_20250286.html,1,0
George Gershwin,Someone To Watch Over Me Lyrics,"
                    There's a saying old says that love is blind,
Still we're often told, ""Seek and ye shall find.""
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind.
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet;
He's the big affair I cannot forget.
Only man I ever think of with regret.
I'd like to add his initials to my monogram.
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?
Chorus:
There's a somebody I'm longing to see,
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me.
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood.
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me.
Although he may not be the man some girls think of as handsome.
To my heart he carries the key.
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed,
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone who'll watch over me.

Meeting you today
Has given me a wonderful idea

The two of us, a perfect team,

You readin Heine,
Me somewhere in China!

Losing at backgammon!

Spent with Schopenhauer!

From millionaires to caddies

You wore down my resistance :

You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you, I shall never, never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view.
I've got a crush on you, Sweetie pie.
All the day and night-time, hear me sigh

That I could fall with so much emotion
Could you coo?

For a cunning cottage we could share?
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you

I'm building castles high
They're born anew, their days are few
Just like a sweet butterfly
And as the daylight is dawning
They come again in the morning

I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
Nearly reach the sky
Then like my dreams they fade and die
Fortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air

When shadows creep, when I'm asleep
To lands of hope I stray
Then at daybreak, when I awake
My bluebird flutters away
Happiness, you seem so near me
Happiness, come forth and cheer me

I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
Nearly reach the sky

All you preachers
Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.
It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;
Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practise,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go...
Chorus
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way!
I've got theblues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes! Go on and carry me there!
I'll build a stairway toparadise
With a new step ev'ry day.
Verse Two
Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.
In time you'll getsaint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise;
Let me give you advice.

When it'll drive me insane.

Without any warning,

Once it didn't matter 
But now you're doing wrong; 
When you start to patter

Decide to run along 
Somewhere far away off

Ever tell me she will care,
I'm certain, It's the final cutain.

Who tell me fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love, but not for me,
A lucky star's above, but not for me,
With love to lead the way,
I found more skys of grey,
Than any Russian play could guarantee.

I was a fool to fall, and get that way,
Hi ho! Alas! And also Lack a day!
Although I can't dismiss,
The memory of her kiss,
I guess she's not for me.

When every happy plot,
Ends in a marriage knot,
And there's no knot for me.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/g/george+gershwin/ + /g/george+gershwin/but+not+for+me_20162546.html,1,0

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

Naturally, you thought you couldn't.
And probably we shouldn't.
But aren't you kind of glad we did?

Nevertheless, they'll call it shameless
So let's keep the lady nameless
But aren't you kind of glad we did?

Socially, I'll be an outcast
Obviously, we dined alone
On my good name there will be doubt cast
With never a sign of any chaperon.

No matter how they may construe it
Whether or not, we have to rue it

Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?

George Gershwin,(I've Got) Beginner's Luck Lyrics,"
                    At any gambling casino
From Monte Carlo to Reno,
They tell you that a beginner
Comes out a winner.
Beginner fishing for flounder
Will catch a seventeen pounder;
That's what I've always heard
And always thought absurd,
But now I believe every word!

For I've got beginner's luck;
The first time I'm in love
I'm in love with you,
Gosh I'm lucky!

I've got beginner's luck;
There never was such a smile
Or such eyes of blue,
Gosh I'm fortunate!

This thing we've begun
Is much more than a pastime,
For this time is the one
Where the first time is the last time!

I've got beginner's luck,
Lucky through and through,
For the first time that I'm in love,
I'm in love with you!

I've got beginner's luck;
The first time I'm in love
I'm in love with you,
Gosh I'm lucky!

I've got beginner's luck;
They told me beginners win,
Now I know it's true,
Gosh I'm fortunate!

This thing we've begun
Is much more than a pastime,
For this time is the one
Where the first time is the last time!

Lucky through and through,
For the first time that I'm in love,
I'm in love with you!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/g/george+gershwin/ + /g/george+gershwin/ive+got+beginners+luck_21365799.html,1,0

George Gershwin,It's De-Lovely Lyrics,"
                    The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si.

George Gershwin,How Long Has This Been Going On? Lyrics,"
                    As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my anties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.
So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! , how I lost out!

I could cry salty tears;
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt;
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Clombus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendez-vous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

And oh! If we ever part,
Then that might break my heart!

So, if you like pyjamas and I like pyjahmas,
I'll wear pyjamas and give up pyjahmas.
For we know we need each other, 
So we better call the calling off off.

Let's call the whole thing off!

You say after and I say awfter;

Why don't they stop someday, address themselves this way?
Why are we here? Where are we going? It's time that we found out.
We're not here to stay; we're on a short holiday.

Life is just a bowl of cherries.
Don't take it serious; life's so mysterious.
You work, you save, you worry so,
But you can't take your dough when you go, go, go.
So keep repeating it's the berries,
The strongest oak must fall,
The sweet things in life, to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you've never owned?
Life is just a bowl of cherries,
So live and laugh at it all.

Life is just a bowl of cherries.
Don't take it serious; it's too mysterious.
At eight each morning I have got a date,
To take my plunge 'round the Empire State.
You'll admit it's not the berries,
In a building that's so tall;
There's a guy in the show, the girls love to kiss;
Get thousands a week just for crooning like this:

No armored knight out of a book
Was more enchanted by a loralei

For the right time
After reaching so long for a star
All at once from long and lonely night time
And despite time, here you are

And spend the next eternity or two

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops

Harold Arlen,Smoke Rings Lyrics,"
                    Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?

Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow

Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue
Oh little smoke rings I love                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/harold+arlen/ + /h/harold+arlen/smoke+rings_21369259.html,1,0

Gather 'round me, while I preach some
Feel a sermon coming on here
The topic will be sin
And that's what I'm agin'
If you wanna hear my story
Then settle back and just sit tight
While I start reviewing
The attitude of doing right

You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister inbetween

You got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
And have faith, or pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene

To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale, noah in the ark,
What did they do, just when everything looked so dark?
Man, they said, we better

Harold Arlen,The Man That Got Away Lyrics,"
                    The night is bitter,
The stars have lost their glitter,
The winds grow colder,
And suddenly you're older
And all because of
The man that got away.

No more his eager call,
The writing's on the wall,
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.
The man that won you
Has run off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen it's final inning,
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game.

No more that all-time thrill
For you've been through the mill,
And never a new love will
Be the same.

Good riddance, good-bye.
Every trick of his you're on to -
But fools will be fools and where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher,
It's lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up,
Tomorrow he may turn up.
There's just no letup
The livelong night and day.

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman
Looking for the man that got away . . .

Suddenly the cyclone came, I'll never be the same

The same old tingle that I feel

Down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf that's
Caught in the tide

I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with
Such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You are the lover that I've waited for

The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

In the machine

Easy and sad

In a gentleman's code

And I've got a lot of things I'd like to say
And if I'm gloomy, please listen to me
Till it's talked away
Well that's how it goes, and joe I know your gettin'
Anxious to close
Thanks for the cheer

Or it's gonna explode

Harold Arlen,Let's Take A Walk Around The Block Lyrics,"

And never further south than the aquarium
I've seen the charm of jersey city, but first let me remark
I saw it from the empire state solarium

But we've been putting nickels in the postal savings bank
And when those nickels pile up, we can toddle off in swank
And I don't mean an ordinary cook's tour
I mean a cabin de-luxe tour

Someday we'll go places
New lands and new faces
The day we quit punching the clock
The future looks pleasant,
But at present
Let's take a walk around the block.

You're just the companion
I want at grand canyon
For throwing old blades down the rock
The money we have'll go for travel
Meantime, let's walk around the block.

Gangway, we'll begin
When our, ship comes in
I'll sit on your lap
All over the map

To london in may time
To venice in play time
To paris in time for a frock
To boston in bean time
Darling, meantime
Let's take a walk around the block.

[Bridge:]

In winter at christmas,
We'll visit the isthmus
And see how they lock up a lock
And then in caracas, on a jackass,
We'll take a ride around the block.

We'll keep to our promise,
To visit st. Thomas
And then at jamaica we'll dock
The prospect is thrilling,
Still I am willing,
Just now to talk around the block.

Onward, to cathay
Then to mandalay
Boom on to bangkok
P'r'aps vladivostok

We'll send the folks cables
Accumulate labels
Buy souvenirs till we're in hock
But since we are flat in old manhattan

                    Maybe I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Life isn't long enough baby, but I can love you as long as I live.

Maybe I can't give you diamonds and things like I want to,
But I can promise you, baby, I'm gonna want to as long as I live.

I never cared, but now I'm scared, I won't live long enough.
That's why I wear my rubbers when it rains and eat an apple every day then see
The doctor anyway.

What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.



I'll even wear long underwear, when winter breezes blow
I'm gonna take good care of me because, a sneeze or two might mean the flu,
And that would never never do

What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.

Ding-Dong Saddam was found
Where was he? .... Underground!

Hi Ho the Merry-o
They searched high, they searched low
Ding dong Saddam Hussein was found

Down in a Spider hole
Below, below, below yo-ho
And now we know

Harold Arlen,Hooray For Love Lyrics,"
                    It's the wonder of the world, it's a rocket to the moon
It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...

Here's to my best romance, here's to my worst romance
Here's to my first romance - ages ago
Here's to the boys I've kissed, and to complete the list
Here's to the boys who said ""no!""

Love, love, hooray for love
Who was ever too blase for love
Make this the night for love
If we have to fight, let's fight for love

Some sigh and cry for love
Ah, but in pa-ree they die for love
Some waste away for love
Just the same - hooray for love!



It's the rocket to the moon, with a touch of ""clare de lune""
It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...

Some trust to fate for love,
Others have to take off weight for love
Some go berzerk for love
Loafers even go to work for love

Sad songs are sobbed for love
People have their noses bobbed for love
Some say we pay for love
Just the same - hooray for love!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/harold+arlen/ + /h/harold+arlen/hooray+for+love_20064369.html,1,0

                    Music by harold arlen.
Lyrics by E. Y. (yip) harburg

I never feel a thing is real
When I'm away from you
Out of your embrace
The world's a temporary parking place

Mmm, mm, mm, mm
A bubble for a minute
Mmm, mm, mm, mm
You smile, the bubble has a rainbow in it

Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a barnum and bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/harold+arlen/ + /h/harold+arlen/its+only+a+paper+moon_20064353.html,1,0
Harold Arlen,Kickin' The Gong Around Lyrics,"
                    It was down in chinatown,
All the cokies laid around,
Some were high and some were mighty low;
There were millions on the floor
When a knock came on the door,
And there stood old smoky joe.

He was sweatin', cold and pale,
He was lookin' for his frail,
He was broke and all his junk ran out;
Nobody made a sound,
As he stood and looked around,
And then you hear old smoky shout:

Saying, ""tell me where is minnie?
My poor minnie!
Has she been here,
Kicking the gong around? ""

""if you don't know minnie,
She's tall and skinny,
She gets her pleasure
Kicking the gong around!""

[scat chorus]

""just tell her smoky joe
Was here and had to go.""
And as he departed,
The curtains parted,
And there stood minnie

Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

Hercules,Go The Distance [Michael Bolton] Lyrics,"
                    I have often dreamed
Of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome
Would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer
When they see my face
And a voice keeps saying
This is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday
I can go the distance
I will find my way
If I can be strong
I know ev'ry mile
Will be worth my while
When I go the distance
I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road
To embrace my fate
Though that road may wander
It will lead me to you
And a thousand years
Would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime
But somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back
I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track
No, I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't lose hope
'Till I go the distance
And my journey is complete

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart

Like a shooting star
I will go the distance
I will search the world
I will face it's harms
I don't care how far
I can go the distance
'Till I find my hero's welcome
Waiting in your arms

I will search the world
I will face it's harms

Hercules,Zero To Hero Lyrics,"
                    Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking sro
He was a no one
A zero, zero
Now he's a honcho
He's a hero
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero just like that (snaps)

When he smiled
The girls went wild with
Oohs and aahs
And they slapped his face
On ev'ry vase
(On ev'ry ""vahse"")

From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian urn?

Say amen
There he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up
Just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs

Hercie, he comes
He sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were
Going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains, and spunk
From zero to hero a major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk

Who put the glad in gladiator?
Hercules!
Whose daring deeds are great theater?
Hercules
Isn't he bold?
No one braver
Is he sweet
Our fav'rite flavor
Hercules, Hercules...

Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high
And the nicest guy
Not conceited

He was a nothin'
A zero, zero
Now he's a honcho

From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero

With blockeads just like you

Each and ev'ryone a disappointment
Pain for which there ain't no ointment
So much for excuses
Though a kid of Zeus' is
Asking me to jump into the fray
My answer is two words--
O. K.
You win
Oh gods

A fellow who'd ring the bell for once--
Not the gong
The kind who wins trophies
Won't settle for low fees
At least semi pro fees, but no--
I get the greenhorn

I've been out to pasture pal, my ambition gone
Content to spend lazy days and to graze my lawn
But you need an advisor
A satyr, but wiser
A good merchandiser, and oohh!
There goes my ulcer!

I'm down to one last hope
And I hope it's you
Though, kid, you're not exactly a dream come true
I've trained enough turkeys
Who never came through
You're my one last hope so you'll have to do

Demigods have faced the odds
And ended up a mockery
Don't believe the stories
That you read on all the crockery

To be a true hero, kid, is a dying art
Like painting a masterpiece
It's a work of heart
It takes more than sinew
Comes down to what's in you
You have to continue to grow
Now that's more like it!

I'm down to one last shot
And my last high note
Before that blasted underworld
Gets my goat
My dreams are on you, kid
Go make 'em come true
Climb that uphill slope
Keep pushing that envelope
You're my one last hope

With blue eyes and tiny feet
Her name is Rosabelle Magee
And she tips the scale at three o three

Oh gee, but ain't it grand to have a girl
So big and fat that when you hug her
You don't know where you're at
You have to take a piece of chalk in your hand
And hug a way and chalk a mark
To see where you began

One day when I was a huggin' and a chalkin'
And a chalkin' and a huggin' a way
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' around the other way 'round the mountain
Comin' around the other way

Nobody ever said I'm weak
My bones don't ache and my joints creak
But I, I grow absolutely limp
Every time I kiss my baby blimp, oh

One day I had a yen for some one leaner, she was meaner than a
Mink in a pen. So I left her now I'm happy as a fella could be
Huggin' and chalkin' in once a gain 'round my Rosie
Huggin' and chalkin' in once again

One day I was a huggin' and a chalkin' and a beggin' her to be my bride
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' a round the other side of the mountain

I need someone to lend me a fifty dollar bill and then
I'll leave Hong Kong behind me for happiness once again""

Hoagy Carmichael,Lazy River Lyrics,"
                    Up a lazy river by the old mill run
Lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger awhile in the shade of the tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me

You know, before your sister was born
This is what your Mama did for a living
Music opened a whole new world to me
No matter how bad I feel, no matter how sad or sick I am
I just touched these keys and poof, like magic
I always seemed to feel better
I've always known you had talent, Bobbie
This piano is for you, Charlie worked hard for it
See God wouldn't have made you suffer so much
If you weren't gonna make up for it later

How happy you can be
Up a lazy river with me

Throw away your troubles, baby
Dream a dream with me

Up a lazy river with me

From the halfway mark

To be a star, a big star
You gotta be talented obviously
You gotta be tenacious, have charisma
But most importantly, you've gotta have it
A great intangible and you've got it all, Bobbie
You're gonna be bigger than Sinatra
I'd settle for a little Jolson Mama, Mama, Mama

Ah ah ah, there are blue skies up above
Forever long as we're in love
We'll be up a lazy river
Up a crazy lazy river
Up a lazy river
I ain't goin' your way
Get out of my way
Up a lazy river with me

                    One night long ago by the light of the moon,
An old music master sat composing a tune,
His spirit was soaring and his heart full of joy,
When right out of nowhere stepped a little colored boy.
You gotta jump it, music master,
You gotta play that rhythm faster,
You're never gonna get it played
On the Happy Cat Hit Parade.
You better tell your friend Beethoven,
And Mister Reginald De Koven
They better do the same as you,
Or they're gonna be corny too.
Long about nineteen seventeen
Jazz'll come upon the scene,
Then about nineteen thirty-five
You'll begin to hear swing,
Boogie Woogie and Jive,
You gotta show that big broadcaster
That you're a solid music master,
And you'll achieve posterity,
That's a bit of advice from me.
The old music master simply sat there amazed,
As wide-eyed and open-mouthed he gazed and he gazed
How can you be certain little boy, tell me how?
Because I was born, my friend,
A hundred years from now.
He hit a chord that rocked the spinet
And disappeared into the infinite,
And up until the present day,
You can take it from me,
He's as right as can be,
Ev'rything has happened that-a-way.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/hoagy+carmichael/ + /h/hoagy+carmichael/the+old+music+master_21214285.html,1,0

The nights we used to linger in the hall?
Your father didn't like me at all

The reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest

Hoagy Carmichael,New Orleans Lyrics,"
                    If you've never seen a quaint old Southern city
Just think of New, think of New Orleans

If you've never seen that town, boy, it's a pity
There's nothing like, nothing like New Orleans

It will remind you old fashioned lace
A glass of wine will greet your smiling face

And if you ever see a black-eyed gal like mine, boy
Oh, then you're right in it, right in New Orleans                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/hoagy+carmichael/ + /h/hoagy+carmichael/new+orleans_20835993.html,1,0
Irving Berlin,Doin' What Comes Natur'lly Lyrics,"
                    Annie oakley and female chorus:
Folks are dumb where I come from,
They ain't had any learning.
Still they're happy as can be
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally).
Folks like us could never fuss
With schools and books and learning.
Still we've gone from A to Z,
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally)
You don't have to know how to read or write
When you're out with a feller in the pale moonlight.
You don't have to look in a book to find out
What he thinks of the moon and what is on his mind.
That comes naturally (that comes naturally).
My uncle out in Texas can't even write his name.
He signs his checks with ""x's""
But they cash them just the same.
If you saw my pa and ma,
You'd know they had no learning,
Still they've raised a family
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally)
Cousin Jack has never read an almanac on drinking
Still he's always on the spree
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally).
Sister Sal who's musical has never had a lesson,
Still she's learned to sing off-key
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally).
You don't have to go a private school
Not to pick up a penny near a stubborn mule,
You don't have to have a professor's dome
Not to go for the honey when the bee's not home.
That comes naturally (that comes naturally).
My tiny baby brother, who's never read a book,
Knows one s** from the other,
All he had to do was look,
Grandpa Bill is on the hill
With someone he just married.
There he is at ninety-three,
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/doin+what+comes+naturlly_20186161.html,1,0

I can't believe that it's happened,
And still it's true.

I got lost in his arms, and I had to stay.
It was dark in his arms, and I lost my way.
From the dark came a voice, and it seemed to say,
""there you go, there you go.""

How I felt, as I fell, I just can't recall.
But his arms held me fast and it broke the fall.
And I said to my heart as it foolishly
Kepte jumping all around.

I know where to find the boys
I don't go through a club or two
I just find you and there are the boys
To get you alone I strive
You ask me to tea at five
I find you then with other men
And wonder when my chance will arrive

How's chances, say, how are the chances
Of making you love me the way I love you

How many young men must I fight with
To be in right with
In right with you

How's chances for one of those glances
A glimpse of the heaven I'm longing to see

How's chances to end all your romances
And start taking your chances with me

Five hundred Indians and fifty squaws
Ten feature acts and there's the special feature still

Did you ever see a hold up?
-No, sir
Then gather closer
And let me give you some of the atmosphere

The hour is midnight and all is still
We see the stagecoach climbing up a hill
Going along a mountain trail carrying passengers and mail
Never suspecting danger as they roll along
The watchful driver is in his seat
His trusty rifle lying at his feet
Some of the passengers inside seem to be dozing as they ride
Never suspecting there is something really wrong

Suddenly there's a shout
-What is it all about?
What is it all about you ask? It's Indians
-Indians!
Indians
-Indians!
Very notable, cut your throat-able Indians
-Indians!

Just when they've taken ev'ryone by force
Who makes an entrance on a big white horse?
Who starts a' shootin' till there's no one left to kill
-Gen'ral Grant?
No! Colonel Buff'lo Bill!

A Riviera chateau and a lot of other things
And I'm blue, so blue am I
Lots of ready money in seven diff'rent banks
I counted up this morning, it's about a million francs
And I'm blue, so blue, and I know why

I've got Harlem on my mind
I've a longing to be lowdown
And my ""parlez-vous"" will not ring true
With Harlem on my mind

I've been wined and I've been dined
But I'm heading for a showdown
'Cause I can't go on from night to dawn
With Harlem on my mind

I go to supper with a French Marquis
Each evening after the show
My lips begin to whisper ""Mon Cheri""
But my heart keeps singing ""Hi-de-ho""

I've become too darn refined
And at night I hate to go down
To the high-falutin' flat that Lady Mendel designed
With Harlem on my mind

Em'ralds in my bracelets, diamonds in my rings
A Riviera chateau and a lot of other things
And I'm blue, so blue am I

As a child I went wild when a band played
How I ran to the man when his hand swayed

Divine
But today when they play I could hiss them
Ev'ry bar is a jar to my system
But there's one musical instrument that I call mine

I love a piano, I love a piano
I love to hear somebody play
Upon a piano, a grand piano
It simply carries me away

I love to run my fingers o'er the keys, the ivories

And with the pedal I love to meddle
When padarewski comes this way
I'm so delighted if I'm invited
To hear that long haired genius play

So you can keep your fiddle and your bow
Give me a p-i-a-n-o, oh, oh
I love to stop right beside an upright
Or a high toned baby grand

When a green tetrazine starts to warble
I grow cold as an old piece of marble
I allude to the crude little party singer who don't know when to pause
At her best I detest the soprano
But I run to the one at the piano

What a tale could be told if we went for an old fashioned walk.
Let's take a stroll through the park, down a lane where it's dark
And a heart that's controlled, may relax on an old fashioned walk.
I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart,
There's nothing like walking and having a ""heart to heart.""
I know a girl who declined, couldn't make up her mind.
She was wrapped up and sold, coming home from an old fashioned walk.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/lets+take+an+old+fashioned+walk_20068130.html,1,0
Irving Berlin,Let's Face The Music And Dance Lyrics,"
                    There may be trouble ahead
But while there's music and moonlight (moonlight and music) and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance

Before the fiddlers have fled
Before they ask us to pay the bill, and while we still have the chance
Let's face the music and dance

Soon, we'll be without the moon
Humming a different tune - and then...

There may be teardrops to shed
So (But) while there's music and moonlight (moonlight and music) and love and romance
(Let's face the music and dance, dance)

As you listen to them play don't you get a glow?
If you step out on the floor
You'll forget your trouble
If you go into your dance
You'll forget your woe
So:

Come
Get together
Let the dance floor feel your leather
Step as lightly as a feather
Let yourself go

Come
Hit the timber
Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba?
Let yourself go

Let yourself go
Relax
And let yourself go
Relax
You've got yourself tied up in a knot
The night is cold but the music's hot
So

Come
Cuddle closer
Don't you dare to answer ""no, sir""

Irving Berlin,Lazy Lyrics,"
                    [1st verse:]
Ev'ry time
I see a puppy upon a summer's day
A puppy dog at play
My heart is filled with envy
That's because
My heart is yearning to pass the time away
Like that pup
'cause I'm all fed up
And tho' it's wrong to be
I long to be

[chorus:]
Lazy
I want to be lazy
I want to be out in the sun
With no work to be done

Under that awning
They call the sky
Stretching and yawning
And let the world go drifting by

I want to peep
Through the deep
Tangled wildwood
Counting sheep
'til I sleep
Like a child would

With a great big valise full
Of books to read where it's peaceful
While I'm
Killing time
Being lazy

[2nd verse:]
Life is short
And getting shorter with each day that goes by
And how the time does fly
Before you know, it's over
That's why I'm
In such a hurry to pack my things and fly
To a spot
Where it's nice and hot
And hear the birdies sing
While I'm being                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/lazy_20068127.html,1,0
Irving Berlin,Lady Of The Evening Lyrics,"
                    After the gray of a long dreary day comes the evening
Peaceful and calm as a sheltering palm is the evening
Daytime has gone to rest, there in the golden west
Soon little stars will appear in the sky
Seeming to say, ""We are here, hush-a-bye""

Evening, lady of the evening
I can hear you calling me
Calling, while the shades are falling
Falling over land and sea

You can make the cares and troubles
That followed me through the day
Fold their tents just like the Arabs
And silently steal away

Evening, lady of the evening
I hear you calling me

After the sun when its day's work is done comes the evening
Then with the night comes the angels who light up the evening
There in the sky they stand, each with a torch in hand
Then one by one, little stars in the sky
Look down and say, ""We are here, hush-a-bye""                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/lady+of+the+evening_21299153.html,1,0

You're playing with fire and you're apt to get burned
There's a girl in Tennessee
Who's sorry she met up with me
Can't go back to Tennessee
I'm a bad, bad man
There's a girl in Omaha
But I ran faster than her pa
Can't go back to Omaha
I'm a bad, bad man
There's a girl in Wyoming and they're combing Wyoming
To find the man in white who was out with her that night
There's a girl in Arkansas
The sheriff is her brother-in-law
Can't go back to Arkansas

You're making too much fuss
For we don't give a tinker's cuss
We've been out, yes, each of us
With a bad, bad man
We've been chasing up and down
That other show has just left town
And the one who played the clown
Was a bad, bad man
You may love us and leave us, but the parting won't grieve us
We'll turn the other cheek when the minstrels come next week
When the show folks come to call
A girl may slip but she won't fall
We'll give some but won't give all
To a bad, bad man

And ""this may be it"" from the way that you speak

And now let's make plans for a wonderful week
Monday when my show is done
I'll teach you how to shoot a gun
You may find it lots of fun
With a bad, bad man
Tuesday there's no matinee
But I'll be in my tent all day
You can come around and play
With a bad, bad man
Send your mothers on Wednesday because Wednesday's old hens' day
But Thursday is sublime, I'll have lots of open time
Friday night will be the test
If Saturday you're still my guest
Sunday you can come and rest

Irving Berlin,There's No Business Like Show Business Lyrics,"
                    There's no business like show business like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show

The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men because
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause.
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?

There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back?  Let's go on with the show

(there's no business like show business like no business I know)
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on

(there's no people like show people, they smile when they are low)
Yesterday they told you you would not go far, that night you open and there you are
Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the show!!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/theres+no+business+like+show+business_20068144.html,1,0

They wrote some words to fit
That catchy bit

Why everyone this season

Is strumming and humming a new melody
Come to the casino
And hear them play the Piccolino
Dance with your bambino

To the strains of the catchy Piccolino
Drink your glass of vino
And when you've had your plate of scalopino
Make them play the Piccolino

For the longest while
I'd forget to smile,
Then I met you.
Now that my blue days have passed,
Now that I've found you at last -

I'll be loving you always
With a love that's true always.
When the things you've planned
Need a helping hand,
I will understand always.

Always.

Days may not be fair always,
That's when I'll be there always.
Not for just an hour,
Not for just a day,
Not for just a year,
But always.

I'll be loving you, oh always
With a love that's true always.
When the things you've planned
Need a helping hand,
I will understand always.

Always.

Days may not be fair always,
That's when I'll be there always.
Not for just an hour,
Not for just a day,
Not for just a year,
But always.

Irving Berlin,An Old Fashioned Wedding Lyrics,"
                    Interpolated in 1966 revival]

[Frank:]
We'll have an old-fashioned wedding
Blessed in the good old-fashioned way

I'll vow to love you forever
You'll vow to love and honor and obey

Somewhere in some little chapel
Someday when orange blossoms bloom

We'll have an old-fashioned wedding
A simple wedding for an old-fashioned bride and groom

[Annie:]
I wanna wedding in a big church with bridesmaids and flower girls
A lot of ushers in tailcoats, reporters and photographers

A ceremony by a bishop who will tie the knot and say
""Do you agree to love and honor?"" Love and honor, yes, but not obey

I wanna wedding ring surrounded by diamonds in platinum
A big reception at the Waldorf with champagne and caviar

I wanna wedding like the Vanderbilts have, ev'rything big, not small
If I can't have that kind of a wedding I don't wanna get married at all

[Coda:]

[Frank:]
We'll have an old-fashioned wedding

[Annie:]
If it's not a big wedding I don't wanna get married at all                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/an+old+fashioned+wedding_20277073.html,1,0
Irving Berlin,An Orange Grove In California Lyrics,"
                    I've a longing to go
Where the oranges grow
I know a cozy nest
'Way out west

And I miss it so
California my own
Oh how lonely I've grown
That's why I'm on the run

To the one
I left there all alone

Arm in arm we will rove
Through a sweet orange grove
Far away in California
Like a bird I mean to fly west again

And I'll hold her close to my breast again
When the blossoms unfold
And the green turns to gold
Some fine day in California

You'll see a happy girlie and a happy fellow
'Mid the fields of yellow
In an orange grove                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/an+orange+grove+in+california_21299155.html,1,0

Irving Berlin,Can You Use Any Money Today? Lyrics,"
                    Money, money, money, money, money, money
Can you use any money today?
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Nice new bills that we're giving away

There are photographs on ev'ry one
Lincoln, Grant and Washington
Or you might like the ones with Henry Clay
Can you use any money today?

Two million, four million, six million, eight million, ten
Take what you want, when it's gone you can come back again
Bills that haven't been printed yet
You can have them by the sack

Coins that haven't been minted yet
That you never have to give back
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Uncle Sam puts it right on the line

And if we ever run out of checks for him to sign
You can have mine
All of mine
You can have mine

Money, money, money, money, money, money
Can you use any dollars today?
Money, money, money, money, money, money
We've so much that it gets in our way

In our Treas'ry there's a mighty sum
Millions we've subtracted from
The envelopes that hold our take home pay
Can you use any money today?

Home in the states underground there's a cave full of gold
Back up a truck and we'll fill it with all it can hold
Take ten million and please don't fuss
If you find it can't be spent

You can lend it right back to us
And we'll pay you seven percent
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Uncle Sam puts it right on the line

And if that feller with whiskers ever should decline
You can have mine
All of mine
You can have mine                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/can+you+use+any+money+today_21298925.html,1,0

All those charms
In one man's arms
Makes you easy to dance with

Irving Berlin,"You'd Be Surprised, Song (from ""Ziegfeld Follies Of 1919"") Lyrics","
                    [1st verse:]
Johnny was bashful and shy
Nobody understood why 
Mary loved him
All the other girls passed him by
Everyone wanted to know
How she could pick such a beau
With a twinkle in her eye
She made this reply
[1st chorus:]
He's not so good in a crowd but when you get him alone
You'd be surprised
He isn't much at a dance but then when he takes you home
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look like much of a lover
But don't judge a book by it's cover
He's got the face of an Angel
But there's a Devil in his eye
He's such a delicate thing but when he starts in to squeeze
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look very strong but when you sit on his knee
You'd be surprised
At a party or at a ball
I've got to admit that he's nothing at all
But in a morris chair
You'd be surprised
[2nd verse:]
Mary continued to praise
Johnny's remarkable ways
To the ladies
And you know advertising pays
Now Johnny's never alone
He has the busiest phone
Almost every other day
A new girl will say
[2nd chorus:]
He's not so good in the house but on a bench in the park
You'd be surprised
He isn't much in the light but when he gets in the dark 
You'd be surprised
I know he looks as slow as the Erie
But you don't know the half of it, dearie
He looks as cold as an Eskimo
But there's fire in his eyes
He doesn't say very much but when he starts in to speak
You'd be surprised
He's not so good at the start but at the end of the week
You'd be surprised
On a streetcar or in a train
You'd think he was born without any brain
But in a taxicab
You'd be surprised                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/youd+be+surprised+song+from+ziegfeld+follies+of+1919_21299041.html,1,0

The sweet used-to-be
That was once you and me

Irving Berlin,You Can't Get A Man With A Gun Lyrics,"
                    Oh, my mother was frightened by a shotgun, they say
That's why I'm such a wonderful shot.
I'd be out in the cactus and I'd practice all day,
And now tell me what have I got?
I'm quick on the trigger with targets not much bigger than a pinpoint
I'm number one, but my score with a feller
Is lower than a celler, oh you can't get a man with a gun.
When I'm with a pistol, I sparkle like a crystal
Yes, I shine like the morning sun,
But I lose all my luster, when with a bronco buster,
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun
If I went to battle with someone's herd of cattle
You'd have steak when the job was done.
But, if I shot the herder, they'd holler bloody murder
And you can't shoot a male in the tail like a quail,
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
I'm cool, brave, and daring to see a lion glaring
When I'm out with my Remington.
But a look from a mister will raise a fever blister
Oh you can't get a man with a gun
The gals with umbrellas are always out with fellers
In the rain or the blazin sun
But a man never trifles with gals who carry rifles
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun.
A man's love is mighty, he'll even buy a nightie
For a gal who he thinks is fun.
But they don't buy pajamas for pistol packin mamas
And you can't get a hug from a mug, with a slug
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/you+cant+get+a+man+with+a+gun_20351548.html,1,0

Just like a Siamese twin
I mean to stick to you
Until you do
I won't take it on the chin
You'll never leave me flat
I'm not a ""last year's hat""
That you can cast aside
I've got my pride
And I won't stand for that
You can't brush me off
As you would a speck of powder, you may try
But you can't brush me off
You can't shout me down
You can yell but I'll yell louder, you can try
But you can't brush me off

Won't go
No

You've got me wrong, no doubt
I give you all my time
Believe me, I'm
Not looking for some way out
I want you for my wife
Sharing my care and strife
And that may not be fun
For when it's done
You're stuck with me for life
You can't brush me off
As you would a fresh mosquito, you may try
But you can't brush me off
You can't rub me out
Like a spot on my tuxedo, you may try
But you can't brush me off
You can cut me dead but I won't mind it
You may injure my pride
Still I'll never decide
To go

Like a colored pullman porter, you may try
But you can't brush me off
You can't lock me out
Like a frightened farmer's daughter, you may try
But you can't brush me off
You can drop a hint but I won't take it
You can tell me bad news
I intend to refuse
To go
No

He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
I'm giving him the sack
And he can go right back where he came from
I could never make him happy
He'd be better off with you
I'm afraid I never loved him
All I ever wanted to do was

Run my fingers thru his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near
Give him babies one for ev'ry year, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him
For he's not the man for me

I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
He isn't my concern
And he can just return where he came from
I would look a trifle silly
Taking him away from you
That was never my intention
All I ever wanted to do was

Close the window while he soundly slept
Raid the icebox where the food is kept
Cook a breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray
After breakfast clear the things away
Bring the papers and when they've been read
Spend the balance of the day in bed, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him

What'll I do
When you are far away
And I am blue
What'll I do?

What'll I do?
When I am wond'ring who
Is kissing you
What'll I do?

What'll I do with just a photograph
To tell my troubles to?

When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true
What'll I do?

Irving Berlin,What The Well Dressed Man In Harlem Will Wear Lyrics,"
                    There's a change in fashion that shows
In those Lenox Avenue clothes
Mister Dude has disappeared with his flashy tie
You'll see in the Harlem Esquire
What the well-dressed man will desire
When he's struttin' down the street with his sweetie-pie

Sun tan, shade of green
Or an olive drab color scheme
That's what the well-dressed man in Harlem will wear

Dressed up in O.D.'s
With a tin hat for overseas
That's what the well-dressed man in Harlem will wear

Top hat, white tie and tails no more
They've been put away till after the war

If you want to know
Take a look at Brown Bomber Joe
That's what the well-dressed man in Harlem will wear                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/what+the+well+dressed+man+in+harlem+will+wear_21299865.html,1,0
Irving Berlin,What Chance Have I With Love? Lyrics,"
                    Love is beautiful, love is swell
Love is as sweet as a nut
Love is grander than tongue can tell
Love is remarkable, but
Look at what it did to Antony
It made a fool out of Antony
If love could do that to Antony
What chance have I with love?
Look at what it did to Romeo
It dealt poor Romey an awful blow
If love could do that to Romeo
What chance have I with love?
Look at what it did to Samson
'Til he lost his hair he was brave
If a haircut could weaken Samson
They could murder me with a shave
Look at what it did to Bonaparte
He lost his head when he lost his heart
If he kicked over the apple cart
What chance have I
An ordinary guy
What chance have I with love                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/what+chance+have+i+with+love_20340428.html,1,0

A top hat, a white tie and tails""

They listened while a sergeant was laying down the law
They stood there at attention, their faces turning red
The sergeant looked them over and this is what he said
This is the Army, Mister Jones!
No private rooms or telephones
You had your breakfast in bed before
But you won't have it there any more
This is the Army, Mister Green!
We like the barracks nice and clean
You had a housemaid to clean your floor
But she won't help you out any more
Do what the buglers command
They're in the Army and not in a band

To hold a girl in your arms is wonderful, wonderful

Were not fashioned for brides and grooms
A little place is where we should be
Great big troubles and great big cares

Come from houses with marble stairs
A little place for you and for me

Just a little room or two can more than do a little man and wife
That's if they're contented with the little things in life
Living on a larger scale would soon entail a lot of care and strife
We could be so happy with the little things in life

A little rain, a little sun, a little work, a little fun
A little time for loving when the day is done
And a little thing that cries for lullabies could make a man and wife

                    My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone

Irving Berlin,The Hostess With The Mostes' On The Ball Lyrics,"
                    I was born on a thousand acres of Oklahoma land
Nothing grew on the thousand acres for it was gravel and sand
One day father started digging in a field
Hoping to find some soil
He dug and he dug and what do you think?
Oil, oil, oil
The money rolled in and I rolled out with a fortune piled so high
Washington was my destination
And now who am I?
I'm the chosen party giver
For the White House clientele
And they know that I deliver
What it takes to make 'em jell
And in Washington I'm known by one and all
As the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
They could go to Elsa Maxwell
When they had an axe to grind
They could always grind their axe well
At the parties she designed
Now the hatchet grinders all prefer to call
On the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
I've a great big bar and good caviar
Yes, the best that can be found
And a large amount in my bank account
When election time comes 'round
If you're feeling presidential
You can make it, yes, indeed
There are just three things essential
Let me tell you all you need
Is an ounce of wisdom and a pound of gall
And the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
An Ambassador has just reached the shore
He's a man of many loves
An important gent from the Orient
To be handled with kid gloves
He can come and let his hair down
Have the best time of his life
Even bring his new affair down
Introduce her as his wife
But she mustn't leave her panties in the hall
For the hostess who's the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
[Encore:]
I've been highly complimented
And I thank you what is more
You'll be damned well represented
By your new ambassador
For my one ambition is to make them fall
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
In the handbag that I'll carry
There's a precious little note
To their highnesses from Harry
Introducing me he wrote:
""I'll appreciate a favor large or small
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball""
There'll be no mistakes, I've got what it takes
To make friends across the sea
I'll make being smart an important part
Of my foreign policy
I'll cement our good relations
When I give my first affair
There'll be special invitations
To the Duke and Duchess there
Who's already written asking them to call
Not the priestess with the leastes'
But the hostess who's the hostess with the mostes' on the ball                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/the+hostess+with+the+mostes+on+the+ball_20221408.html,1,0

To keep me safe from one

And I can't escape no how

But my heart won't listen now.

Like an organ-grinder's bear,
Like a knight without his armor,
Like Samson without his hair.

Once I got stuck on a sweet little German
And oh what a German was she
The best that was walking, well what's the use talking
Was just made to order for me
So lovely, and witty, more yet she was pretty
You don't know until you have tried
She had such a figure, it couldn't be bigger
And there was some more yet beside

[chorus:]
Oh how that German could love
With a feeling that came from the heart
She called me her honey, her angel, her money
She pushed ev'ry word out so smart
She spoke like a speaker, and oh what a speech
Like no other speaker could speak
Ach my what a German when she kissed her Herman
It stayed on my cheek for a week

[2nd verse:]
This girl could squeeze, and it never would hurt
For that lady knew just how to squeeze
Her loving was killing, more yet she was willing
You never would have to say please
I just couldn't stop her, for dinner and supper
Some kisses and hugs was the food
When she wasn't nice it was more better twice
When she's bad she was better than good

[2nd chorus]
Oh how that German could love
With a sweetness that's sweeter than sweet
Just say what you please, you would hug and you'd squeeze
Just the shoes that she wore on her feet
Her smile was like money that somebody owed you
That somebody wanted to give
When you felt like dying and she started sighing
Ach my it was worthwhile to live

[3rd verse:]
Sometimes we'd love for a week at a time
And it only would seem like a day
How well I remember, one night in December
I felt like the middle of May
I'll bet all I'm worth that when she came on earth
All the angels went out on parade
No other one turned up, I think that they burned up
The pattern from which she was made

[3rd chorus:]
Oh how that German could love
With a love like you see in a play
When she said, ""My dear,"" it would ring in my ear
For a year, and a week and a day
Her no was like yes, and her yes was like no
It was something like yes, it was, well
When we got together ach donner und vetter

Irving Berlin,Overture Lyrics,"
                    [On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/overture_21301103.html,1,0

'Twas from a man I used to know
About a year or so ago, before he departed
He is just as happy as can be

I'll tell you what he said to me
He said, ""If ever you get heavy-hearted
Pack up your sins and go to the devil in Hades
You'll meet the finest of gentlemen and the finest of ladies
They'd rather be down below than up above

Hades is full of thousands of Joneses and Browns
O'Hoolihans, Cohens, and Bradys
You'll hear a heavenly tune that went to the devil
Because the jazz bands they started pickin' it
Then put a trick in it, a jazzy kick in it

They've got a couple of old reformers in heaven
Making them go to bed at eleven
Pack up your sins and go to the Devil
And you'll never have to go to bed at all

If you care to dwell where the weather is hot
H-E-double-L is a wonderful spot
If you need a rest and you're all out of sorts
Hades is the best of the winter resorts

Paradise doesn't compare: all the nice people are there
They come there from everywhere
Just to revel with Mister Devil
Nothing on his mind but a couple of horns

Satan is waitin' with his jazz band
And his band came from Alabam' with a melody hot
No one gives a damn if it's music or not
Satan's melody makes you want to dance forever

Irving Berlin,Steppin' Out With My Baby Lyrics,"
                    Here he comes lookin' for his baby
It's for sure, sure and not for maybe
Don't ask when will the lucky day be
Here he comes and let him tell you himself:

If I seem to scintillate
It's because I've got a date
A date with a package of
The good things that come with love
You don't have to ask me
I won't waste your time
But if you should ask me
Why I feel sublime
I'm

Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
It's for sure, not for maybe
That I'm all dressed up tonight

Steppin' out with my honey
Can't be bad to feel so good
Never felt quite so sunny
And I keep on knockin' wood

There'll be smooth sailin' 'cause I'm trimmin' my sails
With a bright shine on my shoes and on my nails
[alternate line: in my top hat and my white tie and my tails]

Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
Ask me when will the day be
The big day may be tonight                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/steppin+out+with+my+baby_20068109.html,1,0
Irving Berlin,Something To Dance About Lyrics,"
                    An old hand at giving parties
And I've learned an awful lot
The best reason for a party
And what keeps it boiling hot
An occasion when you've got

Something to dance about
Someone to dance it with
Something to dance it to
To a fox-trot or a waltz

Put on your dancing shoes
Here comes some happy news
Break up in twos and twos
To a fox-trot or a waltz

You and someone have parted
And your lonely heart yearns
While you're there broken hearted
Suddenly he returns

That's something to dance about
With someone to dance it with
Pick something to dance it to
To a fox-trot or a waltz

To a Charleston or a waltz
To a Tango or a waltz

Dance to the blues
Something to dance about
Someone to dance it with
Something to dance it to Blues

Dance it to a rhumba
Ah

To a fox-trot, Charleston, Tango or a waltz

Come on, there's lots of fun in store for you
See how the other half lives on park avenue

Let's go slumming, take me slumming
Let's go slumming on park avenue

Let us hide behind a pair of fancy glasses
And make faces when a member of the classes passes

Let's go smelling where they're dwelling
Sniffing ev'rything the way they do

Let us go to it, they do it
Why can't we do it too?
Let's go slumming, nose thumbing, on park avenue

Let's go slumming, take me slumming
Let's go slumming on park avenue

Where the social hearts for broadway lights are throbbing
And they spend their nights in smart cafes hobknobbing, snobbing

Come let's eye them, pass right by them
Looking down our noses as they do

Let us go to it, they do it
Why can't we do it too?

There were never such devoted sisters,
Never had to have a chaperone, no sir,
I'm there to keep my eye on her
Caring, sharing
Every little thing that we are wearing
When a certain gentleman arrived from rome
She wore the dress, and I stayed home
All kinds of weather, we stick together
The same in the rain and sun
Two different faces, but in tight places
We think and we act as one
Those who've seen us
Know that not a thing could come between us
Many men have tried to split us up, but no one can

While you're alone,
I'll tell the waiter to tell
Him he's wanted on the telephone.

One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember the night
The night you said, ""i love you""
Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
You loved me too, my dreams had come true, and all the world was
May
But soon the maytime turned to december

Upon Lennox Avenue
On that famous thoroughfare
With their noses in the air

High hats and narrow collars
White spats and fifteen dollars
Spending every dime
For a wonderful time

Why don't you go where Harlem sits
Puttin' on the Ritz
Spangled Gowns upon the bevy of
High browns from down the levy
All misfits
Puttin' on the Ritz

Every Thursday evening with her swell beaus
Rubbin' elbows

Come with me and we'll attend their jubilee
And see them spend
Their last two bits
Puttin' on the Ritz

High browns from down the levy

 But when he comes back dat day is fine, 
 De sun will shine! 
 He kin come home as late as kin be, 
 Home widout him ain't no home to me.

 An' good for nuthin' too

 When dere is work to do.

Leave it to Jane, Jane, Jane
I don't know why you should make me
Ask of a plan from you
She is the girl with brains

I've always tried to do
Every thing I can for you
No problem you can wish
On her, gives her a strain

She'll tackle many a storm, and daily
If something is on your mind
And I can see that there is
Not a doubt of it

Comfort you soon will find
Leave it to me
I can get you out of it
If you have started worrying
Kindly refrain
And just hand over the whole thing to Jane

(Spoken)
Well Jane
Why don't you tell us
How do you do it?
Yes Jane, come on Jane, tell us
Oh well, it's really very simple
I just study up on the famous
Women of history
You mean like Lucrecia Borgia?
Well, no, not exactly, listen

 Verse 1 

 The game of ""just supposing"" is the sweetest game I know, 
 Our dreams are more romantic than the world we see. 
 And if the things we dream about don't happen to be so, 
 That's just an unimportant technicality. 

 Refrain: 

 We could make believe I love you, 
 Only make believe that you love me. 
 Others find peace of mind in pretending; 

 Couldn't you?  Couldn't I?  Couldn't we 
 Make believe our lips are blending 
 In a phantom kiss or two, or three? 
 Might as well make believe I love you, 
 For to tell the truth, I do. 

 Verse 2 

 Your pardon I pray, 'twas too much to say, 
 The words that betray my heart. 
 We only pretend, 
 You do not offend, 
 In playing a lover's part.

I of course replied, something here inside cannot be denied.
They said someday you'll find all who love are blind,
When your heart's on fire, you must realize,
Smoke gets in your eyes.
So I chaffed and then I gaily laughed,
To think that they could doubt my love,
Yet today, my love has flown away,
I am without my love.
Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide,
So I smile and say when a lovely flame dies,

Johnny Mercer,Winter Wonderland Lyrics,"
                    I really can't stay
But, baby, it's cold outside
I got to go way
But. Baby, it's cold outside
This evening's has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So I'd  better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Maybe just a half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hand, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride
I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out
Ahh, but it's cold outside

I simply must go
But, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no
But, baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is visious
Eww, your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But, baby, you'll freeze out there
See ya, say, lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thi                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/johnny+mercer/ + /j/johnny+mercer/winter+wonderland_20345888.html,1,0

With Paul Weston and the Pied Pipers
Winter Wonderland
""Now for a little change in pace we've sent Johnny Mercer up to the bandstand to join Paul Weston and the Pied Pipers in the nostalgic song of Christmas time, Winter Wonderland.""
Sleigh bells ring.
Are you listening?
In the lane,
Snow is glistening.
A beautiful sight.
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird;
Here to stay is a new bird.
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?""
We'll say, ""No man.""
But you can do the job when you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream
By the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
We'll pretend our snowman's parson brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?""
We'll say, ""No man.""
But you can do the job
When you're in town.Ooh ooh!

All armed with photos from local rotos
With their hair in ribbon and legs in tights

But if you think that you can be an actor, see Mr. Factor

A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""

Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""

Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Johnny Mercer,The Girl Friend Of The Whirling Dervish Lyrics,"
                    One fine day, I chanced to stray
On a little side street in old Bombay
And met a sentimental oriental
She saw me and I saw she
Had a manner too bold and much too free
Her eyes were positively detrimental
When I asked about this gay coquette
I discovered much to my regret

She's the girl friend of the whirling dervish
She's the sweetest one he's found
But ev'ry night, in the mellow moonlight
When he's out dervishing with all his might
She gives him the run-around

All the boy friends of the whirling dervish
Are his best friends to his face
But there's no doubt, when he isn't about
They all come hurrying to take her out
She leads him a dizzy pace

He dreams of a Hindu honeymoon
He doesn't dream that ev'ry night when he goes out
To make an honest rupee
She steps out to make a lotta whoopee

Oh, the love song of the whirling dervish
Has a sweet and tender sound
But will he burn if he ever should learn
That while he's doing her a real good turn
She gives him the runaround

She's got a nervish, throwin' him a curvish
Which, of course, he doesn't deservish

Sam wants to boil a ham,
Grace votes for Bouillabaisse stew.
Jake wants a weeny bake,
Steak and a layer cake,
He'll get a tummy ache too.
We'll rent a tent or tepee.
Let the town crier cry.
And if it's RSVP
This is what I'll reply:

In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Tell 'em I'll be there
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Better save a chair
When the party's gettin' a glow on
And singin' fills the air
In the shank of the night
When the doin's are right
You can tell 'em I'll be there

Ev'ryone gaily cried,
""You comin' to the fracas?""
Over his specs he sighed:

In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Tell 'em I'll be there
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Slickum on my hair.

And it seems that I can see
The gleamin' candlelight,
Atill shinin' bright,
Through the sycamores for me.

The new mown hay sends all its fragrance
From the fields I used to roam.
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash,
Then I long for my Indiana home.

Oh, I have always been a wanderer
Over land and sea,
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me;
A vision fair I see,
Again I long to be;

Back home again in Indiana,

The gleamin' candlelight,

Johnny Mercer,Summer Wind Lyrics,"
                    The summer wind came blowing in from across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long, we sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flying by
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind and the winter winds, they have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies, through nights that never end
My fick-le friend, the summer wind

The summer wind
One summer wind

Things are hot here now they say,
There's a new gal in town.
Gals are jealous, there's no doubt. 
All the guys just rave about
Sweet, Sweet Georgia Brown.
And ever since she came, the common folks all claim, say;

No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).
It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town.
Since she came why it's a shame how she's cooled 'em down.
Fellas that she can't get must be fellas that she ain't met.
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her, Sweet Georgia Brown. 

All you gals will get the blues, 
all you pals will surely lose.
And, there's but one excuse.
Now I've told you who she was, 
and I've told you what she does,
Still, give this gal her dues.
This pretty maiden's prayer is answered anywhere 

No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).
All those tips the porter slips to Sweet Georgia Brown
They buy clothes at fashion shows for one dollar down.
Fellas, won'tcha tip your hats. Oh boy, ain't she the cats?
Who's that mister, tain't her sister, It's Sweet Georgia Brown.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/johnny+mercer/ + /j/johnny+mercer/sweet+georgia+brown_21193041.html,1,0

The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine

If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.
You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""
Because your feet they can't refuse.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane;
Can't keep still, Tho it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree;
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody Grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan?, Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, But Royal Garden Blues.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/johnny+mercer/ + /j/johnny+mercer/royal+garden+blues_21194225.html,1,0
Johnny Mercer,Personality Lyrics,"
                    Personality
Johnny Mercer
Words by Johnny Burke
Music by Jimmy Van Heusen

Peaked at # 1 in 1946
Competing versions charted by Bing Crosby (#9) and Dinah Shore (#10)
Sung by Dorothy Lamour in ""The Road To Utopia"" also starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby

When Madam Pompadour was on a ballroom floor
Said all the gentlemen ""Obviously,""
""The madam has the cutest personality""

And think of all the books about Du Barry's looks
What was it made her the toast of Paree?
She had a well-developed personality

(What did Romeo see in Juliet?)
(Or Figaro in Figarette?)
(Or Jupiter in Juno?)
You know!

And when Salome danced and had the boys entranced
No doubt it must have been easy to see
That she knew how to use her personality

(A girl can learn to spell and take dictation well)
(And never sit on the boss's left knee)
(Unless she's got a perfect personality)

(A girl can get somewhere in spite of stringy hair)
(Or even just a bit bowed at the knee)
(If she can show a faultless personality)

Why are certain girls offered certain things
Like sable coats and wedding rings?
By men who wear their spats right?
(That's right!)

(So don'tcha say ""I'm smart and have the kindest heart""
(Or ""what a wonderful sister I'd be"")

Just tell me how you like my
Mercer ""Rufff!!

The fairy tale I read when I was so high;
No armoured knight out of a book
Could find a more enchanted Lorelei than I.

After waiting so long for the right time,
After reaching so long for a star,
All at once from the long and lonely night time,
And despite time, here you are!

And his business is writing songs
It's a kind of a gift and I get a big lift
From his melodies and diphthongs

We got to talk him once
I was curious as could be
To explain what to do, let him tell it to you
Just the way it was told to me

First you write a little ol' tune, real easy
Not as hard to play as let's say part cheesy
Real simple chords in the key of C
A melody you can groove

Next you add some little ol' words on to it
Try to get some people who'll sing to do it
Then if they say, “My have you got a hit”
You act non committal and say, “Just a little ol' tune”

Now record your little ol' tune, just hum it
Could you try to fancy it up? Far from it
Dub in some top tenor harmony
Just me, me, me, as you groove

Yes, next you sing a baritone part from way back
Add a zoom, zoom, bass and then start the playback
And when they say, “Ma, he's singing forte”
You act non committal and say, “Just a little ol' tune”
You act non committal and say, “Just a little, just a little ol' tune”                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/johnny+mercer/ + /j/johnny+mercer/little+ol+tune_20826560.html,1,0

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you

Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright

A sleighing song tonight

In a one horse open sleigh, hey

When he was mummy's boy

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side

The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot
What?

Bells, bells all the way
I don't know whose playing 'em bells
But I wish they'ed sound that way

Hey, bells, bells all the way
Oh listen to the very merry melody we play

Johnny Mercer,Jamboree Jones Lyrics,"
                    I'll begin the story
Out in West Virginia
Is a little college
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

All the student body
Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it

Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch `em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

`Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)
And then the students all began to yell

The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.
Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still

Just as it always will
And there's a picture in the hall of fame
You'll find the boy in the frame who won the game

Meets an old immovable object like me

When an irrepressible smile such as yours
Warms an old implacable heart such as mine
Don't say no because I insist.
Somewhere, somehow,
Someone's gonna be kissed.
So en garde who knows what the fates have in store
from their vast mysterious sky?
I'll try hard ignoring those lips I adore
but how long can anyone try?
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might,
Chances are some heavenly star spangled night
We'll find out as sure as we live

I adore this [incomprehensible]

[incomprehensible]

There's a burlesque theater where the gang loves to go
To see queenie the cutie of the burlesque show
And the thrill of the evening is when out queenie skips
And the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off, take it off"", cries a voice from the rear
""Take it off, take it off"", soon it's all you can hear
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops and always just in time

She's as fresh and as wholesome as the flowers in May
And she hopes to retire to the farm someday
But you can't buy a farm until you're up in the chips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off, take it off"", all the customers shout
""Down in front, down in front"", while the band beats it out
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops and always just in time

Queenie, queen of them all
Queenie, someday you'll fall
Someday church bells will chime
In strip polka time

Oh, she hates corny waltzes and she hates the gavotte
And there's one big advantage if the music's hot
It's a fast moving exit just in case something rips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

Drop around, take it in, it's the best in the west
""Take it off, take it off, take it off"", you can yell like the rest
Take her out when it's over, she's a peach when she's dressed
But she stops and always just in time, time, time

Queenie, queen of them all
Queenie, someday you'll fall
Someday church bells will chime

Johnny Mercer,Ace In The Hole Lyrics,"

Who think they’re mighty wise
Just because they know a thing or two

You’ll meet them, night and day
Strollin’ up and down Broadway
Telling of the wonders they can do

Oh, sing it, Bobby boy!
I just did

There’s con men and there’s boosters
There’s card sharks and crapshooters
They congregate around the Metropole

If I knew what that meant, I would agree with him
They wear flashy ties and collars
Yes, but where do they get their dollars?
They all have got an ace, down in the hole

Yes, and some of them write
To the old folks for coin
And that is their ace in the hole

And others have friends
On the old Tenderloin
That’s their old ace in the hole

Why, they’ll tell you of trips
That they’re going to make
From Florida to the North Pole

The fact is, their name would be 'Mud'
Just like a chum playin’ stud
If they lost that old ace in the hole

Oh yes, now, some of them write
You’ll find a lot of them write to the
  (Just a minute, just a minute)

Let the man play his piano solo
But I want to sing tenor
I don’t really care if you sing ten or twenty minutes
After he’s through playin’ piano

Listen to ‘em, I think I make it better than he does
Well, that’s the nastiest remark I’ve ever heard
Listen now, if you don’t like the way I sing
Why don’t you sing?
Sing 'Melancholy Baby', sing something!

Why, they tell you of the trips
They’re gonna make
Over Florida, all the way up to the North Pole
Oh, it’s sad, it's sad, Volare!

But their names would be mud
Like a chum playin’ stud
If they lost that old ace, ace in the hole

Several people heard the Albatross
(Yes)
Whisper Robin is on the sauce

Bob White, nothing but a neophyte
(John, what does that word mean?)
(Amateur)

Even the Pheasant found it unpleasant
Hearing you hit that flat note
Whereas the Sparrow froze to his marrow
When he heard that note

The opinion of the Tufted Grouse
Is you play to an empty house
(Could happen to anybody, sure could)
Get up, off that pair
Shape up, make it dare
Bob White, you gotta sing it out tonight

Take a letter to the Meadowlark
In reply to his rude remark
(Well, the mails must go through)
Bob White, invites you to a bash tonight
(My tux isn't even pressed)

Take a wire to the Nightingale
Tell him Bob ain't begun to wail
Bob White's gonna put him down for spite
(Circulate the word)

Call up the Catbird
Tell that old fat bird
He's gonna sing a storm up
Hip the Canary, it'll be scary
After the warm up

Man, he's even gonna gas the goose
He'll be a' looser than Dr. Seuss

Of meaning that he's gonna be 'right in tune?)
Man, I'm telling you, he's gonna be 'on the moon

Bob White really fought a groovy fight
I thought I had him dead in the third round

Hey, old poppa Red Bird
Who is the head bird
Says you were in there swingin'

Even the Jackdaw
Flew out the back door
Buckin' and wingin'

You instigated such a swingin' gig
That all them quadrapeds wanna dig

He says you got a corny trill
Bob White! Whatcha gonna swing tonight?
I was talkin to the mocking bird
He says you are the worst he's heard,
Bob White! Whatcha gonna swing tonight?

Even the owl-tells me you're foul
Singin those lullaby notes, 
Don't be a bring down 
If you can swing down
Gimme those high notes

There's a lotta talk about you, Bob
and they're sayin you're ""off the cob""
Fake it, Mister B
Take it, follow me, Bob white

Johnny Mercer,Button Up Your Overcoat Lyrics,"

Now that you got me made
Goodness, but I'm afraid
Somethin's gonna happen to you

Listen, big boy
You gotta be hooked, and how
I would die if I should lose you now

Button up your overcoat
When the wind is free
Take good care of yourself
You belong to me

Eat an apple every day
Get to bed by three
Oh, take good care of yourself
You belong to me

Be careful crossing streets, ooh, ooh
Cut out sweets, ooh, ooh
Lay off meat, ooh, ooh
You'll get a pain and ruin your tum-tum

Wear your flannel underwear
When you climb a tree
Oh, take good care of yourself
You belong to me

Button up your overcoat
When the wind is free
Oh, take good care of yourself
You belong to me
Boop-boop-a-doop

When you sass a traffic cop
Use diplomacy
Just take good care of yourself
You belong to me

Beware of frozen funds, ooh, ooh
Stocks and bonds, ooh, ooh
Dockside thugs, ooh, ooh
You'll get a pain and ruin your bankroll

Keep the spoon out of your cup
When you're drinking tea
Oh, take good care of yourself
You belong to me

Don't sit on hornet's tails, ooh, ooh
Or on nails, ooh, ooh
Or third rails, ooh, ooh

Keep away from bootleg hooch

There is so much that we
Don't understand

And the only thing we know
Is things don't always go
The way we planned

But you'll see every day
That we'll never turn away
When it seems all your dreams come undone

We will stand by your side
Filled with hope and filled with pride
We are more than we are
We are one

If there's so much I must be
Can I still just be me
The way I am?

Can I trust in my own heart
Or am I just one part
Of some big  plan?

Even those who are gone
Are with us as we go on
Your journey has only begun

Tears of pain, tears of joy
One thing nothing can destroy
Is our pride, deep inside
We are one

We are one, you and I
We are like the earth and sky
One family under the sun

All the wisdom to lead
All the courage that you need
You will find when you see

Love will find a way

Now I realize
Love is never wrong
And so it never dies
There's a perfect world
Shining in your eyes

And if only they could feel it too
The happiness I feel with you they'll know

We're home

But how to make her see.
The truth about my past.. Impossible!
She'd turn away from me..

Nala-
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what I can't decide.
Why wont he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside......

[Chorus:]-
Can you feel, the love tonight
The peace the evening brings
The world for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

Can you feel the love tonight
You need'nt look too far
Stealing through, the nights uncertanies
Love is where they are......

Timon-
And if, he falls, in love, tonight....*sniff*
It can be, assumed...

His carefree days, with us are history...

Lion King,Can You Feel The Love Tonight Lyrics,"
                    There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you
And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/lion+king/ + /l/lion+king/can+you+feel+the+love+tonight_20570889.html,0,1
Lion King,Be Prepared Lyrics,"
                    I never thought hyenas essential
They're crude and unspeakably plain
But maybe they've a glimmer of potential
If allied to my visishiton and brain

I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are, pay attention
My words are a matter of pride

It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares

So prepare for a chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer

And where do we feature?

Just listen to teacher
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues!
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!

Yeah! Be prepared. We'll be prepared! For what?

For the death of the king

Is he sick?

No, fool! We're going to kill him. And Simba, too

Great idea! Who needs a king?

No king, no king! La la la la la!

Idiots! There will be a king!

But you said...

I will be king! Stick with me and you'll never go hungry again!

Yay, all right! Long live the king!
Long live the king!

It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored

Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!

So prepare for the coup of the century
Be prepared for the murkiest scamoooooo, la-la-la!
Meticulous planningwe'll have food!
Tenacity spanninglots of food
Decades of denialwe repeat
Is simply why I'llendless meat
Be king undisputed
Respected, saluted
And seen for the wonder I am
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!

Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared -

Lion King,The Madness Of King Scar Lyrics,"
                    Zazu, why am I not loved?
I am that rare and awesome thing
I'm every inch a king
Yet I feel a twinge of doubt
As I go walk about

Hey, boss!

When my name is whispered through the pride
Is this talk of love or regicide?

Reggie who?

Tell me I'm adored
Please tell me I'm adored

Hey, boss!

Oh, what is it?

We got a bone to pick with you

There's no food, no water--

Yeah. It's dinnertime, and there ain't no
Stinkin' entrйes!

Oh, you and your petty complaints. You don't know what real hunger is.
Day after day it gnaws at the very core of my being

I had that once. It was worms

No, no, no... It's like an itch... Deep, persistent, profound...

That's it-- worms! When they get really bad all you gotta do is... Hunker
Down and scoot

Thanks for the tip. Ingrates! If it weren't for me you'd be beating off
Buzzards for your next bite!

Yeah, you're our savior, thanks a bunch
But how about some lunch?
It doesn't matter if it's fresh
I need a fix of flesh
My bones have moved to where they've never been
They are on the outside looking in

Are you blaming me?

Oh no, it's the lionesses

You are so adored
Oh, you are so adored

That's more like it

But what I'd give for one more hit
Of wildebeest kielbasa
Or maybe hornbill on the spit...

Oh, how I miss Mufasa

Mufasa?! Mufasa?! How dare you! I told you never to mention that name!

Note taken. I shall never mention ""M-m-m"" again

Even in death, his shadow looms over me
There he is!
No! There he is!
And there!

Calm yourself, Sire, or you'll get another one of your splitting
Headaches!

I am perfectly fine!
I'm better than Mufasa was
I'm revered
I am reviled
I'm idolized
I am despised
I'm keeping calm
I'm going wild!

I tell myself I'm fine
Yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am, no you're not
I tell myself I'm fine

No you're not, yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am
No you're not
Yes, no, yes, no, who am I talking to...?

Oh, pull yourself together, Sire!

Oh, very well. Zazu? Zazu, Zazu, Zazu...?

Yes, Sire?

Nobody loved me, there's the rub, not even as a cub
What did my brother have that I don't have?

Do you want the short list or the long?

Whatever!

Well, he had adoring subjects... A loving family... A devoted queen...

That's it! I need a queen!

A what?

A queen, man! A queen! Without a queen, what am I? A dead end, no line, no
Descendants, no future. With a queen, I'll have cubs... Immortality will
Be mine! Immortality will be mine!

Scar

Ah, Nala... Your timing couldn't have been more perfect. My how you've
Grown

Scar, you have got to do something. We're being forced to overhunt

She's got those assets feminine

You're the king. Control the hyenas

I have to make her mine

You're destroying the Pridelands

Nobility in every gene

If we don't stop now.. Don't you see...

She has to be my queen

... There's still a chance for things to be all right again...

Come, sweet Nala
It's written in the stars

What are you doing? Are you listening to me?

We'll create a host of little Scars

What are you talking about?

Tell me I'm adored

Get away from me

Tell me I'm adored

Be mine

With due sense of decorum and with pride
With deference and great respect very much the norm
Plus a hint of sycophancy on the side
To lay before my ruler all the facts about his realm
To fill him in on all the beastly news

Yes, yes, Zazu, get on with it!

In order that His Majesty stands sturdy at the helm
Aware of all the fauna's latest views

Zazu! The morning report!

Er-- yes, Sire-- the morning report

Chimps are going ape, giraffes remain above it all
Elephants remember, though just what I can't recall
Crocodiles are snapping up fresh offers from the banks
Showed interest in my nest egg but I quickly said ""No thanks!""
We haven't paid the hornbills and the vultures have a hunch
Not everyone invited will be coming back for lunch

This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report

What are you doing, son?

Pouncing

Let and old pro show you how it's done

The buffalo have got a beef
About this season's grassstay low to the ground
Warthogs have been thwarted
In attempts to save their gas
Flamingoes in the pink andyeah, stay low!
Chasing secretary birds
Saffron is this season's color
Seen in all the herdsshh, not a sound
Moving down the rank and filetake it slow
To near the bottom rungone more step
Far too many beetles are
Quite frankly in the dungthen pounce!

How many wonders can one cavern hold?

Sure, she's got everything

No big deal
I want more

I wanna see, wanna see them dancin'
Walking around on those - what do you call 'em?
Oh - feet!

Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a - what's that word again?

Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free - wish I could be
Part of that world

What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
Bet'cha on land they understand,
bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women sick of swimmin'
Ready to stand

I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it - what's the word?
Burn?

The only way to get what you want is
To become a human yourself.

ARIEL
Can you do that?

URSULA
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.
It's what I live for.
To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself.
Poor souls with no one else to turn to.

I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
True? Yes!
And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And here lately, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed (pathetic)

Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, ""Spells, Ursula, please!""
And I help them!
Yes I do

Now it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls

Have we got a deal?

ARIEL
If I become human,
I'll never be with my father or sisters again.

URSULA
That's right...
But you'll have your man, heh heh.
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it? Heh heh.
Oh, and there is one more thing.
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.
You can't get something for nothing, you know!

ARIEL
But I don't have any-

URSULA
I'm not asking much, just a token really, a trifle!
You'll never even miss it...
What I want from you is - your voice.

ARIEL
My voice?

URSULA
You've got it, Sweet-cakes, 
No more talking, singing, ZIP!

ARIEL
But without my voice, how can I-

URSULA
You'll have your looks, your pretty face!
And don't underestimate the importance of body language, ha!

The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore!
Yes on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word
And after all dear, what is idle prattle for?
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who get's her man

Come on you poor unfortunate soul,
Go ahead!
Make your choice!
I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
Ya' poor unfortunate soul
It's sad but true!
If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet,
You've got the pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her boys
The boss is on a roll
This poor unfortunate soul!

Come winds of the Caspian Sea
Larengix glaucitis
Et max laryngitis
La volce to me

Not a word, not a sqeak
Not a peep, not a squeal

So what does it matter
If you become mute (nobody likes a loudmouth!)

I mean it
Silence, silence is golden my dear
Don't you think you should try it
They'll say ""she's so quiet, so shy and so cute!""

Well, take it or leave it, that's all, that's the bargain
Go on, take a stand, make a choice
Remeber you'll get the legs and the lungs and the prince
All I get is the voice

And you'll be
Silent, but silence is golden, sign here
There's no choice for you since

Little Mermaid,Sing A New Song Lyrics,"

Why do all the flounder flee
Everytime they look at me?
Try, but I just don't fit in
I only make crustaceans cringe

Though I thought I had a smile worth sharing
I don't know why I scare the herring
I'm so lonely, sad and blue
What's a monster to do?

[ Ariel ]
You've got to sing
A happier song
It's time to change that same old tune
You've got to move on
Pick yourself up
Brush off your scales
Get that old tired
Whale of a tail
Tapping along
Sing a new song

So come out of your shell
And get into the swim
There's a wonderful world
Waiting for you to jump in

Just say goodbye to the dark and gloomy
Come outside where it's bright and roomy
Try your smile on someone new
And watch what it can do

You've got to sing

Daring the dastards to put up their dukes
Great gobs of gore, we'll storm the shore
And seek the unknown, then can we go home?

Climbed every mountain because it's there
Come on, follow me, we'll make history
To courage, to us, I'll try it, you're bust!

In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?

Under the sea, under the sea
Darling it's better down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we're devoting full time to floating
Under the sea, ha ha...

Down here all the fish is happy
And soft through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad 'cause they in the bowl!
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who goin' be on the plate?

Wo-no, under the sea

It's music to me (music is to me)

Each little slug here cutting a rug here

Well dear friend, it's time to put this letter into a bottle. And hope the ocean current brings it back to you. Maybe soon you'll come to visit me, even if only in your dreams. Just follow the mermaid song and you'll find me. Til then, your friend, Ariel.

[ Mermaids ]

Come to the place where mermaids dwell
Follow the call of trumpet shells
We'll fill your sails with friendly winds
And point the way with shining fins
And you can bid your cares farewell

Come to the place where mermaids dwell
In dreams you know the way so well
For if you hope and you believe
You'll see the golden nets we weave
You'll hear the stories that we tell
Where mermaids dwell

Where mermaids dwell

There are dolphins to ride for pleasure
And starfish that twinkle all night long
Streams of pearls and sunken treasure
And a mermaid song

Come to the place where mermaids dwell
Where shimmering ocean waters swell
Where laughing children of the waves
Play hide and seek among the caves
And ride a seahorse carousel

Come to the place where mermaids dwell

In dreams you know the way so well
For if you hope and you believe
You'll see the golden nets we weave
You'll hear the magic in our spell

Little Mermaid,In My Blue Backyard Lyrics,"

Right through my window a big world of water awaits
To have a sea at your fintips is such a special treat
I take a few steps out the back of my house for all the fun I need

In my blue backyard
It's open and wide and blue as the sky
In my blue backyard
There's no garden to hoe
No seaweeds to mow
Just fine fin friends who love to play
Dolphins to ride, bubbles to chase
Deep in the heart of my blue backyard

Whenever I'm swimming I know I won't see a fence
Out here there's no boundaries except for the continents
The seals and eels and humpbacks, the squid and pompaloo?
Are some of my pals who'll be hanging around so I won't be alone

In my blue backyard
It's open and wide and blue as the sky
In my blue backyard
There's no garden to hoe
No seaweeds to mow
Just fine fin friends who love to play
Dolphins to ride, bubbles to chase
Deep in the heart of my blue backyard

Sometimes I hide in the coral beds that's where I go to think
I don't have to be inside 'til the sun starts to sink

Then I pull out their bones

With a cleaver I hack them in two
I pull out what's inside
And I serve it up fried
God, I love little fishes, don't you?

Here's something for tempting the palette
Prepared in the classic technique
First you pound the fish flat with a malette
Then you slash off their skin
Give their belly a slice
Then you rub some salt in
'Cause it makes it taste nice

Zoot alors, I have missed one!

Sacre bleu, what is this?
How on earth could I miss
Such a sweet little succulent crab
Quel Domage, what a loss
Here we go, in the sauce
Now some flour I think just a dab
Now I stuff you with bread
It don't hurt, 'cause you're dead!
And you're certainly lucky you are
'Cause it's gonna be hot in my big silver pot!

Whirling round and round in circles
With their partners two by two

Romantic songs of yesterday
We will dance the night away

Relax your weary flippers

Just a little love
That's how you begin
Showing him you care
Being there to tuck him in

Helping him to grow
Each and every day
Just a little love

Little Mermaid,Kiss The Girl Lyrics,"
                    Sebastian
Percussion, strings, winds, words

There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's something about her
And you don't know why, but you're dying to try
You wanna kiss the girl

Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know you do
Possible she want you too
There is one way to ask her
It don't take a word, not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl

Sing with me now

Sha-la-la-la-la-la my oh my
Look like the boy too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha-la-la-la-la-la ain't it sad
Ain't it a shame, too bad
He gonna miss the girl

Now's your moment
Floating in the blue lagoon
Boy, you better do it soon
No time will be better
She don't say a word
And she won't say a word
Until you kiss the girl

Sha-la-la-la-la-la don't be scared
You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl
Sha-la-la-la-la-la don't stop now
Don't try to hide it, how?
You wanna kiss the girl

Woh, woh

Sha-la-la-la-la-la float along
And listen to the song
The song say, kiss the girl

Woh, woh

Sha-la-la-la-la-la music play
Do what the music say
You wanna kiss the girl

Frog
You got to

Kiss the girl

Little Mermaid,For A Moment Lyrics,"
                    Okay, get a grip, get a hang of this flipper
It's like slipping two feet into one big huge slipper.
This way is left which way is right
Oh, now I'll be circling in in circles all night

Oh, so this is forward. No problem.

I can't believe I can do this and more
To swim in the sea like I walk on the shore
Out of my shell, not closed up like a clam
look out sea, this is me, here I am

For a moment all of me
Is alive and at home in the sea
I'm swirling and twirling, so graceful and grand
Not stubbing my toes getting stuck in the sand

For a moment life is cool
I'm a splash in the world's biggest pool
This is more than my thoughts ever thought it could be
For a moment, just a moment, lucky me

If only for one moment
I have shared with you all I know
The sea wouldn't be a mystery
But why did you have to go?

Everything's newer, and brighter and bluer
And truer to life than before
Watch me soar

For a moment I can shine
Got a grin and a fin, it works fine
My fingers are wrinkly, I really don't care
If all my curls are curled out of my hair

For a moment I can feel
All the dreams I've been dreaming are real
Wish my mother could hear it, the sea is my song
For a moment, just a moment, I belong

I will find you my darling
And the moment that I do
I'll hold you close, my Melody
And sing the song of the sea with you

Sing the song of the sea with you
For a moment, just a moment, I belong                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/the+little+mermaid/ + /t/the+little+mermaid/for+a+moment_20627888.html,0,1

Little Mermaid,You Wouldn't Want To Mess With Me Lyrics,"
                    With one wave of my hand
You know who's in command
I'm the quintessential queen of sorcery
I keep a potion in my purse
That's worse than any curse
No, you wouldn't want to mess with me

Take a barracuda's nose
And a dozen turtle toes
And the venom of a sea anemone
Eye of urchin, Crab of louie
Stir the goop until it's goey
That's my favourite rancid recipe
No, you wouldn't want to mess with me

::: Later:::

Make way, I'm in charge
Your fate is looming large
It won't do you any good to flee
My concoctions never fail
So you'd better watch your tail
No, you wouldn't want to mess with me

When you think I'm on the brink of going under
I've a way of coming out on top
Oh my darling debutante
I always get just want I want
And I want this mucky luck to stop!

I'm the mistress of mystique
With a slender slim physique
I'm an idol in the sea of infamy
I admit I'm quite a catch
But I've never met my match

So you shouldn't test the best
'Cause you couldn't stand the stress
No, you wouldn't want to mess with me                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/the+little+mermaid/ + /t/the+little+mermaid/you+wouldnt+want+to+mess+with+me_20627862.html,0,1

Mulan,A Girl Worth Fighting For Lyrics,"
                    For a long time we've,
Been marching off to battle.

In our thundering herd,
We feel a lot like cattle.

Like the pounding beat
Our aching feet aren't easy to ignore

Hey! Think of instead,
A girl worth fighting for

Huh?

That's what I said,
A girl worth fighting for...
I want her paler than the moon,
With eyes that shine like stars

My girl will marvel at my strength,
Adore my battle scars.

I couldn't care less what she'll wear or what she looks like.
It all depends on what she cooks like.
Beef, pork, chicken.
Mmm

Bet the local girls thought you were quite the charmer.

And I'll bet the ladies love a man in armor.

You can guess what we
Have missed the most
Since we went off to war!
What do we want?
A girl worth fighting for.

My girl will think I have no faults.

That I'm a major find.

Uhh, How 'bout a girl who's got a brain,
Who always speaks her mind?

Nah!

My manly ways and turn of phrase are sure to thrill her!

He thinks he's such a lady killer.

I've a girl back home,
Who's unlike any other.

Yeah, the only girl who'd love him is his mother.

But when we come home in victory,
They'll line up at the door
What do we want?
A girl worth fighting for.
Wish that I had...
A girl worth fighting for.

Mulan,Reflection Lyrics,"
                    Look at me,
I may never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter.
Can it be,
I'm not meant to play this part?
Now I see, that if I were truly to be myself,
I would break my family's heart.

Who is that girl I see, staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Somehow I cannot hide?
Who I am, though I've tried.
When will my reflection show, who I am, inside?
How I pray, that a time will come,
I can free myself, from their expectations
On that day, I'll discover someway to be myself,
and to make my family proud.
They want a docile lamb,
No-one knows who I am.
Must there be a secret me,
I'm forced to hide?
Must I pretend that I am someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside?                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/mulan/ + /m/mulan/reflection_20618814.html,0,1
Mulan,Make A Man Out Of You Lyrics,"

Let's get down to business
To defeat the Huns.
Did they send me daughters
When I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I've ever met,
But you can bet before were through,
Mister I'll make a man out of you.

Tranquil as a forest,
But on fire within.
Once you find your center,
You are sure to win.
You're a spineless pale pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue.
Somehow I'll make a man out of you.

(Chan-Po)I'm never gonna catch my breath.

(Yow)Say goodbye to those who knew me.

(Ling)Why was I a fool in school for cutting gym?

(Mushu)This guy's got them scared to death!

(Mulan/Ping)Hope he doesn't see right through me.

(Chan-Po)Now I really wish that I knew how to swim!

(Be a man)
We must be swift as the coursing river,
(Be a man)
With all the force of a great typhoon,
(Be a man)
With all the strength of a raging fire,
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.

Time is racing toward us,
'Til the Huns arrive.
Heed my every order,
And you might survive.
You're unsuited for the rage of war,
So pack up, go home, you're through.
How could I make a man out of you?

Blubber like a baby cause her man's gone away
A weepin' and a whalin' that he's done her wrong

Is the only man among men!

I'll buy me a brand new dress to wear
I'll scrub my neck
And I'll brush my hair

Never have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind me
Many a new day will dawn before I do

Many a like lad may kiss and fly
A kiss gone is bygone

'Where has last July gone? '
Never have I wondered through the rye
Wondering where has some guy gone

He had a heart of gold
And he wasn't very old
Oh why did such a fella have to die

Poor Jud is daid
Poor Jud Fry is daid
He's looking oh so peaceful and serene

And serene!

He's all laid down to rest
With his hands across his chest
His fingernails have never looked so clean

And then the preacher'd get up and he'd say: ""Folks, we are gathered
Here to mourn and growl our brother Jud Fry, who hung himself up
By a rope in a smokehouse, and then we have been weepin' and
Wailin' within some of the women. "" And then he'd say: ""Jud was the
Most misunderstood man in the territory. People used to think he was
A mean, ugly fella and they called him a dirty skunk and a northern
Pig stealer.

But the folks that really knowed 'I'm
Knowed that neath those dirty shirts he always wore
There beated a heart as big as all outdoors

As big as all outdoors

Jud Fry loved his fellow man

He loved his fellow man

He loved the birds of the forest
And the bees of the field
He loved the mice and the vermin in the barn
And he treated the rats like equals, which he knew was right!
And he loved the little children
He loved everybody and everything in the world
Only he never let on, so nobody ever noticed

Poor Jud is Daid
Poor Jud Fry is daid
His friends all weep and wail from miles around

Miles around!

The daisies in the dell will give out a different smell
Because poor Jud is underneath the ground

Poor Jud is daid, the candle lights his head
He's layin' in a coffin made of wood

Wood

And folks are feelin' sad cause they used to treat him bad
Now they know their friend has gone for good

Good

He's lookin oh so pretty and so nice
He looks like he's asleep

But it's summer and we're runinng out of ice

Oscar Hammerstein,Shall I Tell You What I Think Of You? Lyrics,"
                    Your servant! Your servant!
Indeed I'm not your servant --
Although you give me less than servant's pay --
I'm a free and independent employe
[Pronounced ""employay""]... (sigh) employee.

Because I'm a woman
You think, like ev'ry woman
I have to be a slave or concubine.
You conceited, self-indulgent libertine!... (sigh)
Libertine! [pronounced ""liberteen""]

How I wished I called him that!
Right to his face! Libertine!
And while we're on the subject, sire,
There are certain goings on around this place
That I wish to tell you I do not admire:
I do not like polygamy
Or even moderate bigamy
I realize
That in your eyes
That clearly makes a prig o' me.

But I am from a civilized land called Wales!
Where men like you are locked in county jails!
In your pursuit of pleasure, you
Have mistresses who treasure you

They have no ken of other men
Beside whom they can measure you

A flock of sheep and you're the only ram
No wonder you're the wonder of Siam!

[Spoken] I'm rather glad I didn't say that...
Not with the women right there... And the children

[Singing] The children, the children,
I'll not forget the children,
No matter where I go I'll always see
Those little faces looking up at me...

At first, when I started to teach,
They were shy and remained out of reach,
But lately I've thought
One or two have been caught
By a word I have said
Or a sentence I've read
And I've heard an occasional question
That implied, at least, a suggestion
That the work I've been trying to do
Was beginning to show with a few...

That Prince Chululongkorn
Is very like his father.
He's stubborn-but inquistitive and smart...
I must leave this place before they break my heart
I must leave this place before they break my heart!

Goodness! I had no idea it was so late.

Shall It tell you what I think of you?
You're spoiled!
You're a conscientious worker
But your spoiled.
Giving credit where it's due
There is much I like in you
But it's also very true
That your spoiled!
Everybody's always bowing to the King
Everybody has to grovel to the King.
By your Buddha you are blessed
By your ladies you're caressed,
But the one who loves you best is the King.

All that bowing and kow-towing
To remind you of your royalty,
I find a most disgusting exhibition.
I wouldn't ask a Siamese cat
To demonstrate his loyalty
By taking this ridiculous position
How would you like it if you were a man
Playing the part of a toad.
Crawling around on your elbows and knees.
Eating the dust of the road!...

Toads! Toads! All of your people are toads!

Oscar Hammerstein,Shall We Dance Lyrics,"
                    (Anna sings)
We've just been introduced
I do not know you well
But when the music started something drew me to your side
So many men and girls are in each others arms
It made me think we might be similarly occupied

Shall we dance, on a bright cloud of music
Shall we fly
Shall we dance
Shall we then say goodnight and mean goodbye
Or per chance, when the last little star has left the sky
Shall we still be together with our arms about each other
And shall you be my new romance
On the clear understanding that this kind of thing can happen
Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance

[Interlude:]

Shall we dance, on a bright cloud of music
Shall we fly
Shall we dance
Shall we then say goodnight and mean goodbye

Or per chance, when the last little star has leave the sky

Shall we still be together with our arms about each other
And shall you be my new...

Oscar Hammerstein,Something Wonderful Lyrics,"
                    This is a man who thinks with his heart, 
His heart is not always wise.
This is a man who stumbles and falls, 
But this is a man who tries.

This is a man you'll forgive and forgive, 
And help protect, as long as you live... 
He will not always say
What you would have him say, 
But now and then he'll do
Something
Wonderful.

He has a thousand dreams
That won't come true, 
You know that he believes in them
And that's enough for you.

You'll always go along, 
Defend him when he's wrong
And tell him, when he's strong
He is
Wonderful
He'll always
Needs your love
And so he'll get your love.
A man who needs your love
Can be
Wonderful.

She'll always go along
Defend him when he's wrong
And tell him when he's strong
He is wonderful.
He'll always need her love
And so he'll get her love

Oscar Hammerstein,The Farmer And The Cowman Lyrics,"
                    Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
One man likes to push a plow
The other likes to chase a cow
But that's no reason why they can't be friends

Territory folks should stick together
Territory folks should all be pals
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals

Territory folks should stick together
Territory folks should all be pals
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals!

I'd like to say a word for the farmer

Well, say it!

He come out west and made a lot of changes

That's right!

He come out west and built a lot of fences
And built 'em right across our cattle ranges!

Why don't you dirt strangers go back to Missouri Where you belong?

We got just as much right here!

Shut up!
The farmer a good in criticism
No matter what the cowman says or thinks
You seldom see 'I'm drinkin in a bar room

Unless somebody else is buying drinks!

Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
The cowman ropes a cow with ease
The farmer steals her butter and cheese
That's no reason why they can't be friends

Territory folks should stick together
Territory folks should all be pals
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals!

I'd like to say a word for the cowboy

You would!

The road he treads is difficult and stony
He rides fer days on end with just a pony for a friend

I sure am feeling sorry for the pony!

The farmer should be sociable with the cowboy
If he rides by an' asks fer food and water
Don't treat 'I'm like a louse
Make him welcome in your house

But be sure that you've locked up your wife and daughters!

(They all offend themselves at the same time and fight)

Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
One man likes to push a plow
The other likes to chase a cow
But that's no reason why they can't be friends

Gun shot

Ain't nobody gonna slug anything! This here's a party!
Break it up ya two ol' fools! Alright, Andrew, sing it.
Dum-dah-dee-um-dum-dum

Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends

Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
One man likes to push a plow
The other likes to chase a cow
But that's no reason why they can't be friends

And when this territory is a state
An' joins the Union just like all the others
The farmer, the cowman, and the merchant
Must all behave theirselves and act like brothers

I'll teach you all a little sayin'
And learn the words by heart the way you should
I don't say I'm no better than anybody else
But I'll be danged if I ain't just as good!

Honey, here's the way it's gonna be
You will sit behind a team of snow white horses
In the slickest gig you've ever seen

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppen strutters
Nosy pokes will peek through their shutters and their eyes will pop!

The wheels are yellow, the upholstry's brown
The dashboard's genuine leather
With eisenglass curtains you can roll right down
In case there's a change in the weather

Two bright side lights winkin' and blinkin'
Ain't no finer rig I'm a thinkin'
You can keep your rig if you're thinkin that I'd keer to swap
Fer that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top

Would you say the fringe was made of silk?
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Has it really got a team of snow white horses?
One's like snow, the other's more like milk

All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top
When we hit that road hell-for-leather
Cats and dogs will dance in the heather
Birds and frogs will sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along
The cows'll moo in the clover
The river will ripple out a whispered song
And whisper over and over
Don't you wish you'd go on forever
Don't you wish you'd go on forever
Don't you wish you'd go on forever
And you'd never stop?
In that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top

I can see the stars gettin' blurry
When we ride back home in the surrey
Ridin' slowly home on the surrey
With the fringe on top
I can feel the day gettin' older
Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder
Till it falls kerplop

The sun is swimming on the rim of a hill
The moon is taking a header
And just when I'm thinking all the earth is still
A lark'll wake up in the meader

Hush, you bird. My baby's a sleepin'
Maybe got a dream worth a keepin'
Whoa, you team and just keep a creepin'
At a slow clip clop
Don't you hurry little surrey

We hide from the moon,
Our meetings are few,
And over too soon.

We speak in a whisper,
Afraid to be heard;
When people are near,
We speak not a word.
Alone in our secret,
Together we sigh,
For one smiling day to be free
To kiss in the sunlight
And say to the sky;
""Behold and believe what you see!
Behold how my lover loves me! ""

Behold how my lover loves me! ""

Why do the neighbors gossip all day behind their doors?

Give me my rose and my glove

Why do you take the trouble to bake my favorite pie?
Grantin' your wish, I carved our initals on that tree
Just keep a slice of all the advice you give so free

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine

Oscar Hammerstein,A Puzzlement Lyrics,"
                    When I was a boy
World was better spot.
What was so was so, 
What was not was not.
Now I am a man; 
World have changed a lot.
Some things nearly so, 
Others nearly not.

There are times I almost think
I am not sure of what I absolutely know.
Very often find confusion
In conclusion I concluded long ago
In my head are many facts T
Hat, as a student, I have studied to procure, 
In my head are many facts... 
Of which I wish I was more certain I was sure! 

[Spoken:] Is a puzzlement
What to tell growing son
What for instance, shall I say to him of women?
Shall I educate him on the ancient lines?
Shall I tell the boy as far as he is able, 
To respect his wives and love his concubines?
Shall I tell him everyone is like the other, 
And the better of the two is really neither?
If I tell him this I think he won't believe it-
And I nearly think that I don't believe it either! 

When my father was a king
He was a king who knew exactly what he knew, 
And his brain was not a thing
Forever swinging to and fro and fro and to.
Shall I, then be like my father
And be willfully unmoveable and strong?
Or is it better to be right?... 
Or am I right when I believe I may be wrong?
Shall I join with other nations in alliance?
If allies are weak, am I not best alone?
If allies are strong with power to protect me, 
Might they not protect me out of all I own?
Is a danger to be trusting one another, 
One will seldom want to do what other wishes; 
Bul unless someday somebody trust somebody
There'll be nothing left on earth exceot fishes! 

There are times I almost think
Nobody sure of what he absolutely know.
Everybody find confusion
In conclusion he concluded long ago
And it puzzle me to learn
That tho' a man may be in doubt of what he know, 
Very quickly he will fight... 
He'll fight to prove that what he does not know is so! 
Oh-h-h-h-h-h Sometimes I think that people going mad! 
Ah-h-h-h-h-h! Sometimes I think that people not so bad! 
But no matter what I think I must go on living life.
As leader of my kingdom I must go forth, 
Be father to my children and husband to each wife
Excetera, excetera, and so forth.
If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way! 
Everyday I try to live another day. If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the
Way! 
Everyday I do my best for one-more day!

When fellers offer you a buggy ride

I'll give an imitation of a crawfish
And dig myself a hole where I can hide

I heard how you was kicken' up some capers
When I was off in Kansas City, Mo.
I heard some things you couldn't print in papers
From fellers who been talkin' like they know! 

Foot! 
I only did the kind of things I orta, sorta
To you I was as faithful as can be, for me
Them stories 'bout the way I lost my bloomers-rumors! 
A lot of tempest in a pot o' tea! 

The whole don't sound very good to me.

Well, you see

I go and sow my last wild oat
I cut out all shenanigans
I save my money, don't gamble or drink
In the back room down at Flannigans! 
I give up lotsa other things
A gentleman never mentions
But before I give up any more
I wanna know your intentions! 

With me, it's all er nuthin'
Is it all or nuthin' with you?
It cain't be in between
It can't be now and then
No half and half romance will do!

All complete with slippers and pipe
Take me like I am er leave me be!

And nuthin's what you'll git from me

Not even somethin'

Nuthin's what you'll git from me!

Would you build me a house
All painted white
Cute and clean and purty and bright

Big enough fer two but not fer three! 

Suposin' that we should have a third one

He'd better look a lot like me

No spittin' image

He'd better look a lot like me! 

With you it's all er nuthin'
All fer you and nothin' fer me
But if a wife is wise, she's gotta realize
That men like you are wild and free

So I ain't gonna fuss, ain't gonna frown
Have your fun, go out on the town
Stay up late and don't come home til three! 
And go right off to sleep if you're sleepy

I think of a night,
When the earth smelled of summer
And the sky was streaked with white,
The soft mist of England
Was sleeping on a hill.

I remember this,
And I always will...
There are new lovers now
On the same silent hill,
Looking on the same blue sea.
And I know Tom and I are a part of them all--
And they're all a part of Tom and me.

Hello young lovers, whoever you are,
I hope your troubles are few.
All my good wishes go with you tonight,
I've been in love like you.

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star,
Be brave and faithful and true,
Cling very close to each other tonight.
I've been in love like you.

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels,
And to fly down the street in a trance.
You fly down a street on the chance that you meet,
And you meet--not really by chance.

Don't cry young lovers, whatever you do,
Don't cry because I'm alone;
All of my memories are happy tonight,
I've had a love of my own.
I've had a love of my own, like yours-
I've had a love of my own.

Be brave and faithful and true,

I knowed what's right an' wrong since I've been ten
I've heard a lot of stories and I reckon they're true
About how girls are put upon by men
I know I musn't fall into the pit
But when I'm with a feller
I ferget!

I'm just a girl who cain't say no
I'm in a terrible fix
I always say 'come on, let's go'
Just when I oughta say 'nix'

When a person tries to kiss a girl
I know she oughta give his face a smack!
But as soon as someone kisses me
I somehow sorta want to kiss him back!

I'm just a fool when lights are low
I cain't be prissy an' quaint
I ain't the type that can faint
How can I be what I ain't
I cain't say no

Watcha gonna do when a feller gets flirty
And starts to talk purty
Whatcha gonna do?
Supposin that he says
Your lips are like cherries
Or roses or berries
Whatcha gonna do?

Supposin that he says
That yer sweeter than cream
And he's gotta have cream or die
Whatcha gonna do when he talks that way?
Spit in his eye?

I'm just a girl who cain't say no
Cain't seem to say it at all
I hate to disserpoint a beau
When he is payin' a call!

Fer a while I act refined and cool
A settin on the velveteen setee
Then I think of that ol' golden rule
And do fer him what he would do fer me

I cain't resist a Romeo
In a sombero and chaps
Soon as I sit on their laps
Somethin' inside of me snaps
I cain't say no!

I'm just a girl who cain't say no
Kissin's my favorite food
With or without the mistletoe
I'm in a holiday mood!

Other girls are coy and hard to catch
But other girls ain't havin' any fun
Every time I lose a wrastlin' match
I have a funny feeling that I won

Though I can feel the undertoe
I never make a complaint
'Till it's too late for restraint
Then when I want to I cain't
I cain't say no!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/o/oscar+hammerstein/ + /o/oscar+hammerstein/i+caint+say+no_20907422.html,1,0
Oscar Hammerstein,I Have Dreamed Lyrics,"
                    I have dreamed that your arms are lovely, 
I have dreamed what a joy you'll be.
I have dreamed every word you whisper.
When you're close, 
Close to me.
How you look in the glow of evening
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view.

In these dreams I've loved you so
That by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you, 
I will love being loved by you.

[TUPTIM]

Alone and awake I've looked at the stars, 
The same that smile on you; 
And time and again I've thought all the things T
Hat you were thinking too.

I have dreamed that your arms are lovely, 
I have dreamed what a joy you'll be.
I have dreamed every word you whisper.
When you're close, 
Close to me.
How you look in the glow of evening
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view.

In these dreams I've loved you so
That by now I think I know.

Oscar Hammerstein,I Whistle A Happy Tune Lyrics,"
                    Whenever I feel afraid
I hold my head erect
And whistle a happy tune
So no one will suspect
I'm afraid

While shivering in my shoes
I strike a careless pose
And whistle a happy tune
And no one ever knows
I'm afraid

The result of this deception
Is very strange to tell
For when I fool the people
I fear I fool myself as well!

I whistle a happy tune
And ev'ry single time
The happiness in the tune
Convinces me that I'm not afraid

Make believe you're brave
And the trick will take you far.
You may be as brave
As you make believe you are

You may be as brave
As you make believe you are

While shivering in my shoes
I strike a careless pose
And whistle a happy tune
And no one ever knows,
I'm afraid

Oscar Hammerstein,Kansas City Lyrics,"
                    I got to Kansas City on a Firday
By Saturday I learned a thing or two
Cuz up to then I didn't have an idy
Of whut the modern world was comin' to!

I counted twenty gas buggies goin' by their sels
Almost every time I took a walk
Then I put my ear to a bell telephone
And a strange woman started in to talk

To you?

What next?

Yeah what?

What next?
Gather round!

Everythin's up to date in Kansas City
They've gone about as fur as they can go
They went and built a skyscraper seven stories high
About as high as a buildin' oughta grow
Everythin's like a dream in Kansas City
It's better than a magic lantren show
You can turn the radiator on
Whenever you want some heat
With every kind of comfort
Every house is all complete
You can walk to privies in the rain
And never wet your feet!
They've gone about as fur as they can go

Yes sir!
They've gone about as fur as they can go

Everythin's up to date in Kansas City
They've gone about as fur as they can go
They've got a big theyater they call a burleeque
For fifty cents you can see a dandy show

Gals?

One of the gals was fat and pink and pretty
As round above as she was round below
I could swear that she was padded
From her shoulder to her heel
But latter in the second act
When she began to peel
She proved that everyhin' she had was absolutely real!
She went about as fur as she can go

Yes sir!
She went about as fur as she can go!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/o/oscar+hammerstein/ + /o/oscar+hammerstein/kansas+city_20907440.html,1,0

The icy sky at night
Our paddles break the water
In a long and hurried flight
From the white man and the fields of green
And the homeland we've never seen
They killed us in our tepee
They cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Cryin' on the ground
But the big guns and the wagon wheels come
Yes, and the night falls on the setting sun
They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little room at the top of the stairs
With an Indian rug and a pipe to share
I wish a was a trapper
I would give thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And to find out how she felt
In the morning on the fields of green
In the homeland we've never seen
Yes and maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
We'll sit and talk of Hollywood
And the good things there for hire
And the Astrodome and the first tepee

Pocahontas,"Mine, Mine, Mine Lyrics","
                    [Ratcliffe]
The gold of Cortйs
The jewels of Pizarro
Will seem like mere trinkets
By this time tomorrow
The gold we find here
Will dwarf them by far
Oh, with all ya got in ya, boys
Dig up Virginia, boys

Mine, boys, mine ev'ry mountain
And dig, boys, dig 'til ya drop
Grab a pick, boys
Quick, boys
Shove in a shovel
Uncover those lovely
Pebbles that sparkle and shine
It's gold and it's mine, mine, mine
English Settlers
Dig and dig and dig and diggety...
Dig and dig and dig and diggety...

Hey nonny nonny
Ho nonny nonny
Ratcliffe
Oh, how I love it!
Riches for Cheap!
Wiggins
There'll be heaps of it...
Ratcliffe
And I'll be on top of the heap!

My rivals back home
It's not that I'm bitter
But think how they'll squirm
When they see how I glitter!
The ladies at court
Will be all a-twitter
The king will reward me
He'll knight me... No, lord me!

It's mine, mine, mind
For the taking
It's mine, boys
Mine me that gold!
With those nuggets dug...

It's glory they'll gimme
My dear friend, King Jimmy
Will probably build me a shrine
When all of the gold is mine

[English Settlers]
Dig and dig and dig and diggety
Dig and dig and dig and diggety-dig!
[Smith]
All of my life, I have searched for a land
Like this one
A wilder, more challenging country
I couldn't design
Hundreds of dangers await
And I don't plan to miss one
In a land I can claim
A land I can tame
The greatest adventure is mine!

[Ratcliffe and English Settlers together]

[Ratcliffe]
Keep on working, lands
Don't be shirking, lands
Mine, boys, mind
Mine me that gold
Beautiful gold
[English Settlers]
Mine
Find a mother lode
Then find another load!
Dig! Dig! And diggety
Dig! Dig! For that gold
All
Make this island
My land!
[Ratcliffe]
Make the mounds big, boys
I'd help you to dig, boys
But I've got this crick in me spine
[Smith]
This land we behold...
[Ratcliffe]
This beauty untold...
[Smith]
A man can be bold!
It all can be sold!

[Ratcliffe and English Settlers together]

[Ratcliffe]
And the gold
Is...
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!

We know which is here
All the riches here
From this minute
This land and what's in it is
Mine!

Pocahontas,Kleuren Van De Wind Lyrics,"
                    Ben ik een onwetende wilde?
Jij bevoer de hele wereld,
Je kijkt vast niet verkeerd.
Toch heb ik het idee,
Dat de wilde van ons twee
Degeen is die niet luistert en
Niet leert.
Die niet leert.

Jij denkt dat land
Waar jij belandt van jou is.
Jij plukt de aarde
Als een aarsgier kaal.
Maar ik weet
Elke rots
En boom,
Elk wezen
Heeft een ziel,
Heeft een leven,
Heeft een taal.

Jij noemt de mensen eigenlijk
Pas mensen als die mensen
Precies zo zijn als jij.
Maar treed eens in het voetspoor
Van een vreemde en dan
Leer je in een oogwenk zoveel bij.

Hoor je ooit de wolf een ode
Brengen aan de maan?
Of vraag jij ooit een lynx waarom
Hij spint?
Ben je doof voor alle stemmen
Van de bergen?
Ben je blind voor alle kleuren
Van de wind?
Ben je blind voor alle kleuren
Van de wind?

Kom rennen, laat je leiden door
De larix.
Het hert toont zijn betoverend domein.
Verover het en rol je door die rijkdom.
Maar vraag nooit what het waard
Zou kunnen zijn.

De regen, de rivier,
Het zijn mijn broeders.
De reiger en de otter,
Lucht en land.
En alles staat met alles
In verbinding.
In een cirkel,
Een oneindig groot verband.

Hoe hoog raakt de esdoorn
Ooit?
Wie de bomen rooit
Hoort het antwoord nooit.
Die hoort nooit de wolf een
Ode brengen aan de maan.
In wit of koper,
Ongeacht je tint.

Blijf niet doof voor alle stemmen
Van de bergen.
Blijf niet blind voor alle kleuren
Van de wind.
Wie de aarde zo begeert,
Vindt slechts aarde tot hij leert
Het te zien
In alle kleuren van
De wind.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/p/pocahontas/ + /p/pocahontas/kleuren+van+de+wind_20611934.html,0,1
Pocahontas,Just Around The Riverbend Lyrics,"
                    [Pocahontas]
What I love most about rivers is:
You can't step in the same river twice
The water's always changing, always flowing
But people, I guess, can't live like that
We all must pay a price
To be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing
What's around the riverbend
Waiting just around the riverbend

I look once more
Just around the riverbend
Beyond the shore
Where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for
What I dream the day might send
Just around the riverbend
For me
Coming for me

I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming
For a handsome sturdy husband
Who builds handsome sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming?
Just around the riverbend
Just around the riverbend

I look once more
Just around the riverbend
Beyond the shore
Somewhere past the sea
Don't know what for...
Why do all my dreams extend
Just around the riverbend?
Just around the riverbend...

Should I choose the smoothest course
Steady as the beating drum?
Should I marry Kocoum?
Is all my dreaming at an end?
Or do you still wait for me, Dream Giver
Just around the riverbend?                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/p/pocahontas/ + /p/pocahontas/just+around+the+riverbend_20611933.html,0,1

                    The earth is cold
The fields are bare
The branches fold against the wind that's everywhere

The birds move on
So they survive
When snow so deep 
The bears all sleep to keep themselves alive

They do what they must for now
And trust in their plan
If I trust in mine, somehow I might find who I am

CHORUS
But where do I go from here?
So many voices ringing in my ear
Which is the voice that I was meant to hear?
How will I know?
Where do I go from here?

My world has changed and so have I
I've learned to choose
And even learned to say goodbye

The path ahead's so hard to see
It winds and bends but where it ends 
Depends on only me

In my heart I don't feel part of so much I've known
Now it seems it's time to start, 
A new life on my own

Pocahontas,Colors Of The Wind Lyrics,"
                    You think I'm just an ignorant savage
And you've been so many places; I guess it must be so
But still I cannot see, if the savage one is me
How can there be so much that you don't know?
You don't know...

You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name.

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle in a hoop that never ends

How high will a sycamore grow?
If you cut it down then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind

You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/p/pocahontas/ + /p/pocahontas/colors+of+the+wind_20465852.html,0,1

If I never felt this love
I would have no inkling of
How precious life can be
If I never held you
I would never have a clue
How at last I'd find in you
The missing part of me
In this world so full of fear
Full of rage and lies
I can see the truth so clear
In your eyes
So dry your eyes
And I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you

I thought our love would be so beautiful
Somehow we'd make the whole world bright
I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong
All they'd leave us were these whispers in the night
But still my heart is saying we were right
For If I never knew you

All these things will come to you in time
On this journey that you're making
There'll be answers that you'll seek

It's you who'll reach the peak

Lift your spirit, set it free

No one to take your hand

You will journey from boy to man

Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of Man, a man in time you'll be

In learning you will teach
And in teaching you will learn
You'll find your place beside the ones you love
Oh, and all the things you dreamed of
The visions that you saw
Well, the time is drawing near now
It's yours to claim it all

Makes me feel like never before
Why do I have
This growing need to be beside her

Ooo, these emotions I never knew
Of some other world far beyond this place
Beyond the trees, above the clouds
I see before me a new horizon

Come with me now to see my world
Where there's beauty beyond your dreams
Can you feel the things I feel
Right now, with you
Take my hand

What does it mean? In these little bric-a-brac A secret's waiting to be cracked These dolls and toys confuse me so Confound it all, I love it though Simple objects, nothing more But something's hidden through a door Though I do not have the key Something's here I cannot see What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? I've read these Christmas books so many times I know the stories, and I know the rhymes I know the Christmas carols all by heart My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart As often as I've read them, something's wrong So hard to put my bony finger on Or perhaps it's really not as deep As I've been led to think Am I trying much too hard? Of course! I've been too close to see The answer's right in front of me Right in front of me It's simple, really, very clear Like music drifting in the air Invisible, but everywhere Just because I cannot see it Doesn't mean I can't believe it You know, I think this Christmas thing Is not as tricky as it seems And why should <i>they </i>have all the fun? It should belong to anyone Not anyone, in fact, but me Why, <i>I</i> could make a Christmas tree And there's no reason I can find I couldn't handle Christmas time I bet I could improve it, too And that's exactly what I'll do",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/jacks-obsession.html,0,0

The Nightmare Before Christmas,Town Meeting Song,"There were objects so peculiar They were not to be believed All around, things to tantalize my brain It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen And as hard as I try I can't seem to describe Like a most improbable dream But you must believe when I tell you this It's as real as my skull, and it does exist Here, let me show you This is a thing called a present The whole thing starts with a box A box? Is it steel? Are there locks? Is it filled with a pox? A pox, how delightful, a pox If you please... Just a box with bright-colored paper And the whole thing's topped with a bow A bow? But why? How ugly! What's in it? What's in it? That's the point of the thing, not to know It's a bat Will it bend? It's a rat Will it break? Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake? Listen now, you don't understand That's not the point of Christmas Land Now, pay attention We pick up an over-sized sock And hang it like this on the wall Oh, yes! Does it still have a foot? Let me see, let me look Is it rotted and covered with gook? Um, let me explain There's no foot inside, but there's candy Or sometimes it's filled with small toys Small toys? Do they bite? Do they snap? Or explode in a sack? Or perhaps they just spring out And scare girls and boys What a splendid idea! This Christmas sounds fun I fully endorse it Let's try it at once Everyone, please now, not so fast There's something here that you don't quite grasp Well, I may as well give them what they want And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last For the ruler of this Christmas Land Is a fearsome king with a deep, mighty voice Least that's what I've come to understand And I've also heard it told That he's something to behold Like a lobster, huge and red And he sets out to slay with his rain gear on Carting bulging sacks with his big, great arms That is, so I've heard it said And on a dark, cold night Under full moonlight He flies into a fog Like a vulture in the sky And they call him Sandy Claws Well, at least they're excited But they don't understand That special kind of feeling in Christmas Land Oh, well",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/town-meeting-song.html,0,0

Winnie the Pooh,So Long," It's not complicated, or very hard to grasp But every time I see you, I laugh I won't get too sappy; I've had no epiphany I just enjoy your company You test my nerves; it makes me stronger So can you bother me a little longer?

Hate to say goodbye, goodbye And I hate to see the end, the end 'Cause it's been so long since I've made a friend Hate to say goodbye, goodbye And I hate to see the end, the end 'Cause it's been so long since I've made a friend like you Some like to be alone, independent and on their own All alone I guess they're free, but not me Not me! Hate to say goodbye, goodbye And I hate to see the end, the end 'Cause it's been so long since I've made a friend Hate to say goodbye, goodbye And I hate to see the end, the end 'Cause it's been so long since I've made a friend like you Hate to say goodbye, goodbye And I hate to see the end, the end 'Cause it's been so long since I've made a friend like you Yes, it's been so long since I've made a friend like you Yes, it's been so long since I've made a friend like you Yes, it's been so long since I've made a friend like you",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/lyricswinnie.html,0,0
