Moana,I Am Moana,"[Gramma Tala:] I know a girl from an island She stands apart from the crowd She loves the sea and her people She makes her whole family proud Sometimes the world seems against you The journey may leave a scar But scars can heal and reveal just Where you are The people you love will change you The things you have learned will guide you And nothing on Earth can silence The quiet voice still inside you And when that voice starts to whisper Moana, you've come so far Moana, listen Do you know who you are? [Moana:] Who am I? I am the girl who loves my island I'm the girl who loves the sea It calls me I am the daughter of the village chief We are descended from voyagers Who found their way across the world They call me I've delivered us to where we are I have journeyed farther I am everything I've learned and more Still it calls me And the call isn't out there at all It's inside me It's like the tide, always falling and rising I will carry you here in my heart You remind me That come what may, I know the way I am Moana!",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/moana-i-am-moana.html

I like how it misbehaves The village may think I'm crazy Or say that I drift too far But once you know what you like, well There you are You are your father's daughter Stubbornness and pride Mind what he says but remember You may hear a voice inside And if the voice starts to whisper To follow the farthest star Moana, that voice inside is Who you are [Villagers]: We make our nets from the fibers (We weave our nets from the fibers) The water is sweet inside (A real tasty treat inside) We use the leaves to build fires (We sing these songs in our choir) We cook up the meat inside (We have mouths to feed inside) [Chief Tui]: The village believes in us (That's right!) The village believes (Ha!) The island gives us what we need And no one leaves [Moana]: So here I'll stay My home, my people beside me And when I think of tomorrow There we are I'll lead the way I'll have my people to guide me We'll build our future together [Villagers]: Where we are [Moana]: 'Cause every path leads you back to [Villagers]: Where you are [Moana]: You can find happiness right [Villagers]: Where you are Where you are",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/moana-where-you-are.html

Well, it's nice to see that humans never change Open your eyes, let's begin Yes, it's really me, it's Maui: breathe it in I know it's a lot: the hair, the bod! When you're staring at a demigod What can I say except you're welcome For the tides, the sun, the sky Hey, it's okay, it's okay You're welcome I'm just an ordinary demiguy Hey!

When the nights got cold Who stole you fire from down below You're lookin' at him, yo Oh, also I lassoed the sun You're welcome! To stretch the days and bring you fun Also I harnessed the breeze You're welcome! To fill your sails and shake your trees So what can I say except you're welcome For the islands I pulled from the sea There's no need to pray, it's okay You're welcome! Ha, I guess it's just my way of being me You're welcome! You're welcome! Well, come to think of it Kid, honestly I could go on and on I can explain every natural phenomenon The tide, the grass, the ground, oh That was Maui just messing around I killed an eel I buried its guts Sprouted a tree, now you got coconuts What's the lesson What is the take-away Don't mess with Maui when he's on a breakaway And the tapestry here on my skin Is a map of the victories I win Look where I've been I make everything happen Look at that mean mini-Maui just tickety-tappin' Ha!

The Nightmare Before Christmas,Jack's Lament,"There are few who deny at what I do I am the best For my talents are renowned far and wide When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night I excel without ever even trying With the slightest little effort of my ghost-like charms I have seen grown men give out a shriek With the wave of my hand and a well-placed moan I have swept the very bravest off their feet Yet year after year it's the same routine And I grow so weary of the sound of screams And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King Have grown so tired of the same old thing Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones An emptiness began to grow There's something out there far from my home A longing that I've never known I'm the master of fright and a demon of light And I'll scare you right out of your pants To a guy in Kentucky I'm Mister Unlucky And I'm known throughout England and France And since I am dead I can take off my head To recite Shakespearean quotations No animal nor man can scream like I can With the fury of my recitations But who here would ever understand That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin Would tire of his crown - if they only understood He'd give it all up if he only could Oh, there's an empty place in my bones That calls out for something unknown The fame and praise come year after year Does nothing for these empty tears",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/jacks-lament.html
The Nightmare Before Christmas,Jack's Obsession,"Something's up with Jack Something's up with Jack Don't know if we're ever Going to get him back He's all alone up there Locked away inside Never says a word Hope he hasn't died Something's up with Jack Something's up with Jack Christmas time is buzzing in my skull Will it let me be? I cannot tell There are so many things I cannot grasp When I think I've got it, and then at last Through my bony fingers it does slip Like a snowflake in a fiery grip Something's here I'm not quite getting Though I try, I keep forgetting Like a memory long since past Here in an instant, gone in a flash What does it mean? What does it mean? In these little bric-a-brac A secret's waiting to be cracked These dolls and toys confuse me so Confound it all, I love it though Simple objects, nothing more But something's hidden through a door Though I do not have the key Something's here I cannot see What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? I've read these Christmas books so many times I know the stories, and I know the rhymes I know the Christmas carols all by heart My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart As often as I've read them, something's wrong So hard to put my bony finger on Or perhaps it's really not as deep As I've been led to think Am I trying much too hard? Of course! I've been too close to see The answer's right in front of me Right in front of me It's simple, really, very clear Like music drifting in the air Invisible, but everywhere Just because I cannot see it Doesn't mean I can't believe it You know, I think this Christmas thing Is not as tricky as it seems And why should <i>they </i>have all the fun? It should belong to anyone Not anyone, in fact, but me Why, <i>I</i> could make a Christmas tree And there's no reason I can find I couldn't handle Christmas time I bet I could improve it, too And that's exactly what I'll do",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/jacks-obsession.html

I went and did my best And, by God, I really tasted something swell And for a moment, why, I even touched the sky And at least I left some stories they can tell, I did And for the first time since I don't remember when I felt just like my old bony self again And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King That's right I am the Pumpkin King, ha ha ha ha!

The Nightmare Before Christmas,Town Meeting Song,"There were objects so peculiar They were not to be believed All around, things to tantalize my brain It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen And as hard as I try I can't seem to describe Like a most improbable dream But you must believe when I tell you this It's as real as my skull, and it does exist Here, let me show you This is a thing called a present The whole thing starts with a box A box? Is it steel? Are there locks? Is it filled with a pox? A pox, how delightful, a pox If you please... Just a box with bright-colored paper And the whole thing's topped with a bow A bow? But why? How ugly! What's in it? What's in it? That's the point of the thing, not to know It's a bat Will it bend? It's a rat Will it break? Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake? Listen now, you don't understand That's not the point of Christmas Land Now, pay attention We pick up an over-sized sock And hang it like this on the wall Oh, yes! Does it still have a foot? Let me see, let me look Is it rotted and covered with gook? Um, let me explain There's no foot inside, but there's candy Or sometimes it's filled with small toys Small toys? Do they bite? Do they snap? Or explode in a sack? Or perhaps they just spring out And scare girls and boys What a splendid idea! This Christmas sounds fun I fully endorse it Let's try it at once Everyone, please now, not so fast There's something here that you don't quite grasp Well, I may as well give them what they want And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last For the ruler of this Christmas Land Is a fearsome king with a deep, mighty voice Least that's what I've come to understand And I've also heard it told That he's something to behold Like a lobster, huge and red And he sets out to slay with his rain gear on Carting bulging sacks with his big, great arms That is, so I've heard it said And on a dark, cold night Under full moonlight He flies into a fog Like a vulture in the sky And they call him Sandy Claws Well, at least they're excited But they don't understand That special kind of feeling in Christmas Land Oh, well",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/town-meeting-song.html
The Nightmare Before Christmas,What's This,"What's this? What's this? There's color everywhere What's this? There's white things in the air What's this? I can't believe my eyes I must be dreaming Wake up, Jack this isn't fair What's this? What's this? What's this? There's something very wrong What's this? There's people singing songs What's this? The streets are lined with little creatures laughing Everybody seems so happy Have I possibly gone daffy? What is this? What's this? There's children throwing snowballs Instead of throwing heads They're busy building toys And absolutely no one's dead There's frost on every window Oh, I can't believe my eyes And in my bones I feel the warmth That's coming from inside Oh, look What's this? They're hanging mistletoe; they kiss? Why, that looks so unique, inspired! They're gathering around to hear a story Roasting chestnuts on a fire What's this? What's this? In here, they've got a little tree How queer And who would ever think? And why? They're covering it with tiny little things They've got electric lights on strings And there's a smile on everyone So, now correct me if I'm wrong This looks like fun, this looks like fun Oh, could it be I got my wish? What's this? Oh, my, what now? The children are asleep But look, there's nothing underneath No ghouls, no witches here to scream And scare them or ensnare them Only little cozy things, secure inside their dreamland What's this? The monsters are all missing And the nightmares can't be found And in their place there seems To be good feeling all around Instead of screams, I swear I can hear music in the air The smell of cakes and pies Are absolutely everywhere The sights, the sounds They're everywhere and all around I've never felt so good before This empty place inside of me is filling up I simply cannot get enough I want it, oh, I want it, oh I want it for my own I've got to know, I've got to know What is this place that I have found? What is this?",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/whats-this.html

Enchanted,Happy Working Song,"All right everyone, let's tidy things up Come my little friends As we all sing a happy little working song Merry little voices clear and strong Come and roll your sleeves up So to speak and pitch in Cleaning crud up in the kitchen As we sing along And trill a cheery tune in the tub As we scrub a stubborn mildew stain Pluck a hairball from the shower drain To the gay refrain Of a happy working song We'll keep singing without fail Otherwise we'd spoil it Hosing down the garbage pail And scrubbing up the toilet Ooh! How we all enjoy letting loose with a little La-da-dum-dum-dum While we're emptying the vacu-um It's such fun to hum A happy working song Oo-ooh A happy working song Oh, how strange a place to be Till Edward comes for me My heart is sighing Still, as long as I am here I guess a new experience Could be worth trying Hey! Keep drying! You can do a lot when you got Such a happy working tune to hum While you're sponging up the soapy scum We adore each filthy chore That we determine So friends even though you're vermin We're a happy working throng Singing as we fetch the detergent box Or the smelly shirts and the stinky socks Sing along If you cannot sing then hum along As we're finishing our happy working song! Ah... Wasn't this fun?",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/lyricsenchanted2.html
Enchanted,So Close,"You're in my arms And all the world is gone The music playing on for only two So close together And when I'm with you So close to feeling alive A life goes by Romantic dreams must die So I bid mine goodbye and never knew So close was waiting, waiting here with you And now forever I know All that I want is to hold you So close So close to reaching that famous happy end Almost believing this one's not pretend Now you're beside me and look how far we've come So far we are so close How could I face the faceless days If I should lose you now? We're so close To reaching that famous happy end And almost believing this one's not pretend Let's go on dreaming though we know we are So close So close And still so far",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/lyricsenchanted4.html
