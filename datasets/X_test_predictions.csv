                    Every time I look down on this timeless town
Whether blue or gray be her skies.
Whether loud be her cheers or soft be her tears,
More and more do I realize:

I love Paris in the springtime.
I love Paris in the fall.
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles,
I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles.

I love Paris every moment,
Every moment of the year.
I love Paris, why, oh why do I love Paris?
Because my love is near.                ","I Love Paris, Song (from ""Can Can"") Lyrics"

I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ahh, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!                ",Fools Rush In Lyrics

What'll I do?
I long for somebody who
Will sympathize with me

I lie awake all night and cry
Nobody loves me
That's why

All by myself in the morning
All by myself in the night

I sit alone with a table and a chair
So unhappy there

All by myself I get lonely
Watching the clock on the shelf

I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
I hate to grow older

by Cole Porter
With a million neon rainbows burning below me,
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar,
Here I sit, above the town,
In my pet-paillated gown,
Down in the depths
Of the ninetieth floor.
While the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet,
And the bars are packed with couples calling for more,
I'm deserted and depressed
In my regal-eagle nest,
Down in the depths
Of the ninetieth floor.
When the only one you wanted wants another,
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?
Why, even the janitor's wife
Has a perfectly good love life,
And here I am, facing tomorrow,
Alone in my sorrow,
Down in the depths
Of the ninetieth floor                ",Down In The Depths (On The Ninetieth&hellip; Lyrics

                    One night long ago by the light of the moon,
An old music master sat composing a tune,
His spirit was soaring and his heart full of joy,
When right out of nowhere stepped a little colored boy.
You gotta jump it, music master,
You gotta play that rhythm faster,
You're never gonna get it played
On the Happy Cat Hit Parade.
You better tell your friend Beethoven,
And Mister Reginald De Koven
They better do the same as you,
Or they're gonna be corny too.
Long about nineteen seventeen
Jazz'll come upon the scene,
Then about nineteen thirty-five
You'll begin to hear swing,
Boogie Woogie and Jive,
You gotta show that big broadcaster
That you're a solid music master,
And you'll achieve posterity,
That's a bit of advice from me.
The old music master simply sat there amazed,
As wide-eyed and open-mouthed he gazed and he gazed
How can you be certain little boy, tell me how?
Because I was born, my friend,
A hundred years from now.
He hit a chord that rocked the spinet
And disappeared into the infinite,
And up until the present day,
You can take it from me,
He's as right as can be,
Ev'rything has happened that-a-way.                ",The Old Music Master Lyrics

Let's get down to business
To defeat the Huns.
Did they send me daughters
When I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I've ever met,
But you can bet before were through,
Mister I'll make a man out of you.

Tranquil as a forest,
But on fire within.
Once you find your center,
You are sure to win.
You're a spineless pale pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue.
Somehow I'll make a man out of you.

(Chan-Po)I'm never gonna catch my breath.

(Yow)Say goodbye to those who knew me.

(Ling)Why was I a fool in school for cutting gym?

(Mushu)This guy's got them scared to death!

(Mulan/Ping)Hope he doesn't see right through me.

(Chan-Po)Now I really wish that I knew how to swim!

We must be swift as the coursing river,

With all the force of a great typhoon,

With all the strength of a raging fire,
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.

Time is racing toward us,
'Til the Huns arrive.
Heed my every order,
And you might survive.
You're unsuited for the rage of war,
So pack up, go home, you're through.
How could I make a man out of you?

And il be snoozin in my hamock by a ripplin stream,
Many miles from any tunnel and the digging team,
Lookin out for number one will be my only dream,
That's all I want, that's all I need.

But now I'm gonna run the sho-o-ow,

                    Verse One
All you preachers
Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.
It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;
Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practise,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go...
Chorus
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way!
I've got theblues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes! Go on and carry me there!
I'll build a stairway toparadise
With a new step ev'ry day.
Verse Two
Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.
In time you'll getsaint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise;
Let me give you advice.

So how can you lose what you've never owned?

To take my plunge 'round the Empire State.

                    Once upon a time, in a faraway land,
A young Prince lived in a shining castle.
Although he had everything his heart desired,
The Prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind.
But then, one winter's night,
An old beggar woman came to the castle
And offered him a single rose In return for shelter from the bitter cold.
Repulsed by her haggard appearance,
The Prince sneered at the gift,
And turned the old woman away.
But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances,
For Beauty is found within.
And when he dismissed her again,
The old woman's ugliness melted away
To reveal a beautiful Enchantress.
The Prince tried to apologize, but it was too late,
For she had seen that there was no love in his heart.
And as punishment,
She transformed him into a hideous beast,
And placed a powerful spell on the castle,
And all who lived there.
Ashamed of his monstrous form,
The beast concealed himself inside his castle,
With a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.
The Rose she had offered,
Was truly an enchanted rose,
Which would bloom until his twenty-first year.
If he could learn to love another,
And earn her love in return
By the time the last petal fell,
Then the spell would be broken.
If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast
For all time.
As the years passed,
He fell into despair, and lost all hope,
For who could ever learn to love... A Beast?                ",Prologue (The Enchantress) Lyrics

                    Julie*But*
somehow I can see Just
exactly how I'd be- If

I loved you Time
and time again I would try to say All
I'd want you to know If
I loved you Words
wouldn't come in an easy way Round
in circles I'd go Longin'
to tell you But
afraid and shy I'd
let my golden chances pass me by Soon
you'd leave me Off
you would go in the mist of day Never
never, to know how I loved you If
I loved you Billy

*Well*
anyway, you, mean you don't love me That's.
what you said isn't, it Julie?

*Yes*
I! 
can smell 'em can, you ah, The
blossoms The. wind brings them down Billy

*There*
ain't much wind tonight Hardly... any You.
can't hear a sound not, the turn of a leaf Nor
the fall of a wave hittin' the sand The
tide's creepin up on the beach like a thief Afraid
to be caught stealin the land On
a night like this I start to wonder What
life is all about Julie

*And*
I always say two heads are better than one to Figure
it out Billy

*I*
don't need you and, don't need anybody helpin' me Well
I, got it figured out for myself We're
not important What. are we A?
couple of specks o' nuthin' Look
up there There's... 
a hell of a lotta stars in the sky And
the sky's so big the sea looks small And
two little people you, and I We
don't count at all You're
a funny kid you, know I?
don't remember meetin' a girl like you Hey.
you're, trying to get me to marry you Julie?

*No*
Billy! 

*Then*
what's puttin into my head baby You're?
different all right I, know what it is You... 
have doped me with that little kid's face right, You've?
adjusted me I'd
wonder what it'd be like Julie... 

*What*
Billy?

*Nothin*
No
I, know what it'd be like It'd
be awful I! can just see myself- Kinda

scrawny and pale Pickin
at my food And
love sick like any other guy I'd
throw away my sweater and dress up like a dude In
a dicky and a collar and a tie If
I loved you Julie

*But*
you don't Billy

*No*
I, don't But! 
somehow I can see Just
exactly how I'd be If
I loved you Time
and time again I would try to say All
I'd want you to know If
I loved you Words
wouldn't come in an easy way Round
in circles I'd go Longin
to tell you But
afraid and shy I'd
let my golden chances pass me by Soon
you'd leave me Off
you'd go in the mist of day Never
never, to know How
I loved you If
I loved you Aha

I'm... not the kind of fella to marry anybody No! 
even, if a girl was foolish enough to want me to I
wouldn't Julie! 

*Don't*
worry about it Billy, Billy

*Who's*
worried Julie?

*You're*
right about there bein' no wind The
blossoms are comin down by themselves Just
they're in time to I reckon                ",If I Loved You Lyrics

                    [Gaston:]       The Beast will make off with your children.
[Mob:]          {gasp}
[Gaston:]       He'll come after them in the night.
[Belle:]        No!
[Gaston:]       We're not safe till his head is mounted on my wall! I
Say we kill the Beast!
[Mob:]          Kill him!

[Man I:]        We're not safe until he's dead
[Man ii:]       He'll come stalking us at night
[Woman:]        Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
[Man iii:]      He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free
[Gaston:]       So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me

Through the mist
Through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer
Then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast
He's got fangs
Razor sharp ones
Massive paws
Killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar
See him foam
But we're not coming home
'Til he's dead
Good and dead
Kill the Beast!

[Belle:]        No! I won't let you do this!
[Gaston:]       If you're not with us, you're against us!
Bring the old man!
[Maurice:]      Get your hands off me!
[Gaston:]       We can't have them running off to warn the creature.
[Belle:]        Let us out!
[Gaston:]       We'll rid the village of this Beast. Who's with me?
[Mob:]          I am! I am! I am!)

Light your torch
Mount your horse
[Gaston:]       screw your courage to the sticking place
[Mob:]          We're counting on Gaston to lead the way
Through a mist
Through a wood
Where within a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see ev'ry day
It's a beast
One as tall as a mountain
We won't rest
'Til he's good and deceased
Sally forth
Tally ho
Grab your sword
Grab your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go!

[Gaston:]       We'll lay siege to the castle and bring back his head!
[Belle:]        I have to warn the Beast! This is all my fault! Oh, Papa,
What are we going to do?
[Maurice:]      Now, now, we'll think of something.

[Mob:]          We don't like
What we don't understand
In fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns
Bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the Beast!

[Cogsworth:]    I knew it! I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up.
[Lumiere:]      Maybe it would have been better if she had never come at all.
Could it be?
[Mrs Potts:]    Is it she?
[Lumiere:]      Sacre Bleu! Invaders!
[Cogsworth:]    Encroachers!
[Mrs Potts:]    And they have the mirror!
[Cogsworth:]    Warn the Master! If it's a fight they want, we'll be
Ready for them! Who's with me?
[Gaston:]       Take whatever booty you can find. But remember, the
Beast is mine!

[Objects:]      Hearts ablaze
Banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger just increased
[Mob:]          Raise the flag
Sing the song
Here we come, we're fifty strong
And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong
Let's kill the Beast!

[Mrs Potts:]    Pardon me, Master.
[Beast:]        Leave me in peace.
[Mrs Potts:]    But sir! The castle is under attack!

[Mob:]          Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast

[Lumiere:]      This isn't working!
[Featherduster:] Oh Lumiere, we must do something!
[Lumiere:]      Wait, I know!)

[Mob:]          Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

[Mrs Potts:]    What shall we do, Master?
[Beast:]        It doesn't matter now. Just let them come.

Has a life, has a spirit, has a name.

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle in a hoop that never ends

How high will a sycamore grow?
If you cut it down then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind

You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind                ",Colors Of The Wind Lyrics

And make faces when a member of the classes passes

Let's go smelling where they're dwelling
Sniffing ev'rything the way they do

Let us go to it, they do it
Why can't we do it too?
Let's go slumming, nose thumbing, on park avenue

Let's go slumming, take me slumming
Let's go slumming on park avenue

Where the social hearts for broadway lights are throbbing
And they spend their nights in smart cafes hobknobbing, snobbing

Come let's eye them, pass right by them
Looking down our noses as they do

Let us go to it, they do it
Why can't we do it too?

They're crude and unspeakably plain
But maybe they've a glimmer of potential
If allied to my visishiton and brain

I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are, pay attention
My words are a matter of pride

It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares

So prepare for a chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer

And where do we feature?

Just listen to teacher
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues!
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!

Yeah! Be prepared. We'll be prepared! For what?

For the death of the king

Is he sick?

No, fool! We're going to kill him. And Simba, too

Great idea! Who needs a king?

No king, no king! La la la la la!

Idiots! There will be a king!

But you said...

I will be king! Stick with me and you'll never go hungry again!

Yay, all right! Long live the king!
Long live the king!

It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored

Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!

So prepare for the coup of the century
Be prepared for the murkiest scamoooooo, la-la-la!
Meticulous planningwe'll have food!
Tenacity spanninglots of food
Decades of denialwe repeat
Is simply why I'llendless meat
Be king undisputed
Respected, saluted
And seen for the wonder I am

Be prepared!

Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show

The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men because
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause.
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?

There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back?  Let's go on with the show

(there's no business like show business like no business I know)
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on

(there's no people like show people, they smile when they are low)
Yesterday they told you you would not go far, that night you open and there you are
Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the show!!                ",There's No Business Like Show Business Lyrics

Gotta get my old tuxedo pressed, gotta sew a button on my vest,
'cause tonight I've gotta look my best, Lulu's back in town.

Gotta get a half a buck somewhere, gotta shine my shoes and slick my hair,
gotta get myself a boutonniere, Lulu's back in town.

You can tell all my pets, all my Harlem coquettes,
Mister Otis regrets, that he won't be aroun'.

You can tell the mailman not to call, I ain't comin' home until the fall
and I might not get back home at all... Lulu's back in town.

Do you hear that playin'?
Yes I hear that playin'.
Do you know who's playin'?
No who is that playin'?
Why it's Gabriel, Gabriel playin',
Gabriel, Gabriel saying,
Will you be ready to go when I blow my horn?

Oh blow, Gabriel blow,
Go an' blow, Gabriel blow,
I've been a sinner', I've been a skank
And now I'm willin' to trim my lamp
So blow, Gabriel blow.
I've been low, Gabriel low,
Mighty low, Gabriel low,
But now since I have seen the light
I'm good by day and I'm good by night
So blow, Gabriel blow.
[Verse:]
Once I was headed for hell,
Once I was headed for hell,
But when I got to Satan's door,
I heard you blowin' on your horn once more
So I said ""Satan, farewell.""
And now I'm all ready to fly,
Just to fly higher and higher,
'cause I've been through brimstone,
And I've been through the fire,
And I've perched my soul,
And my heart too,
So climb up the mountain top and start to
Blow, Gabriel blow,
Go on an' blow, Gabriel blow,
I want to join your happy band,
And play all day in the promised land
So blow, Gabriel blow.
Come on you scamps, get up you sinners,
You're all too full of expensive dinners,
Stand up on your lazy feet and sing!

You can have him
I'm giving him the sack
And he can go right back where he came from
I could never make him happy

I'm afraid I never loved him
All I ever wanted to do was

Run my fingers thru his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near
Give him babies one for ev'ry year, so you see

You can have him, I don't want him

He isn't my concern
And he can just return where he came from
I would look a trifle silly
Taking him away from you
That was never my intention
All I ever wanted to do was

Close the window while he soundly slept
Raid the icebox where the food is kept
Cook a breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray
After breakfast clear the things away
Bring the papers and when they've been read
Spend the balance of the day in bed, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him

That would bore me terrificly too

And now he's dear
And so I'm sure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

[Beast] She glanced this way
I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No it can't be
I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before

[Belle] New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see

[Lumiere] Well, who'd have thought?
[Mrs Potts] Well, bless my soul

[Cogsworth] Well, who'd have known?
[Mrs Potts] Well, who indeed?
[Lumiere] And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?
[Mrs Potts] It's so peculiar. Wait and see

[Lumiere and Cogsworth] We'll wait and see

[All Three] a few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before

[Cogsworth] You know, perhaps there's something there that wasn't
There before

old man sunshine listen you never tell me dreams come true just try it and i'll start a riot beatrice fairfax don't you dare ever tell me she will care i'm certain it's the final cutain i never want to hear from any cheerful pollyannas who tell me fate supplies a mate it's all bananas they're writing songs of love but not for me a lucky star's above but not for me with love to lead the way i found more skys of grey than any russian play could guarantee i was a fool to fall and get that way hi ho alas and also lack a day although i can't dismiss the memory of her kiss i guess she's not for me it all began so well but what an end this is the time a fella needs a friend when every happy plot ends in a marriage knot and there's no knot for me,1,George Gershwin,1,0,"
                    Old Man Sunshine, listen, you,
Never tell me dreams come true,
Just try it, and I'll start a riot,
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare,
Ever tell me she will care,
I'm certain, It's the final cutain.

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell me fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love, but not for me,
A lucky star's above, but not for me,
With love to lead the way,
I found more skys of grey,
Than any Russian play could guarantee.

I was a fool to fall, and get that way,
Hi ho! Alas! And also Lack a day!
Although I can't dismiss,
The memory of her kiss,
I guess she's not for me.

It all began so well, but what an end,
This is the time a fella needs a friend,
When every happy plot,
Ends in a marriage knot,
And there's no knot for me.                ",But Not For Me Lyrics

Leave it to Jane, Jane, Jane
I don't know why you should make me
Ask of a plan from you
She is the girl with brains

I've always tried to do
Every thing I can for you
No problem you can wish
On her, gives her a strain

She'll tackle many a storm, and daily
If something is on your mind
And I can see that there is
Not a doubt of it

Comfort you soon will find
Leave it to me
I can get you out of it
If you have started worrying
Kindly refrain
And just hand over the whole thing to Jane

(Spoken)
Well Jane
Why don't you tell us
How do you do it?
Yes Jane, come on Jane, tell us
Oh well, it's really very simple

Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time

Bring music to the sea

A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""

Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""

Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony

I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I know I could always be good

It's just that, well, people talk.

No, we're not odd, its true
No fam'ly ever saner
Except one uncle who... Well, maybe let that pass
In all you say or do
You couldn't make it plainer
You are your mother's daughter; therefore you are class

So I should just accept
I'm simply not like them

They are the common herd
And you should take my word
You are unique: creme de la creme
No matter what you do
I'm on your side
And if my point of view Is somewhat misty-eyed
There's nothing clearer in my life
Than what I wish and feel for you
And that's a lot...

No matter what they say
You make me proud I love the funny way
You stand out from the crowd

It's my intention my invention
Shows the world out there one day
Just what we've got...

Now some may say all fathers just exaggerate

Belle

That ev'ry daughter's great?

Maurice

You are!

And ev'ry daughter tends to say her father's tops

She pulls out all the stops
To praise him

And quite rightly!

No matter what the pain
We've come this far I pray that you remain
Exactly as you are
This really is a case of father knowing best

Get thee behind me, satan
I mustn't be kissed
But the moon is low and I may let go
Get thee behind me

Someone I'm mad about
Is waiting in the night for me
Someone that I mustn't see
Satan, get thee behind me

last night when we were young love was a star a song unsung life was so new so real so right ages ago last night today the world is old you flew away and time grew cold where is that star that shone so bright ages ago last night to think that spring had depended on merely this a look a kiss to think that something so splendid could slip away in one little daybreak so now let's reminisce and recollect the sighs and the kisses the arms that clung when we were young last night,1,Harold Arlen,1,0,"
                    Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night                ",Last Night When We Were Young Lyrics

                    Just listen to the Bob White
He never could sing right
You should hip it to the latest sound
And the talk that's goin' 'round

Well, I was talking to the parakeet
And he said, ""Man, now about that beat""
(How about that beat?)
""Hey Bob White, ain't you gonna swing tonight?""

Several people heard the Albatross
(Yes)
Whisper Robin is on the sauce
(I know for a fact he's on the wagon)
Bob White, nothing but a neophyte
(John, what does that word mean?)
(Amateur)

Even the Pheasant found it unpleasant
Hearing you hit that flat note
Whereas the Sparrow froze to his marrow
When he heard that note

The opinion of the Tufted Grouse
Is you play to an empty house
(Could happen to anybody, sure could)
Get up, off that pair
Shape up, make it dare
Bob White, you gotta sing it out tonight

Take a letter to the Meadowlark
In reply to his rude remark
(Well, the mails must go through)
Bob White, invites you to a bash tonight
(My tux isn't even pressed)

Take a wire to the Nightingale
Tell him Bob ain't begun to wail
Bob White's gonna put him down for spite
(Circulate the word)

Call up the Catbird
Tell that old fat bird
He's gonna sing a storm up
Hip the Canary, it'll be scary
After the warm up

Man, he's even gonna gas the goose
He'll be a' looser than Dr. Seuss
(Wait a minute John, do I detect a note
Of meaning that he's gonna be 'right in tune?)
Man, I'm telling you, he's gonna be 'on the moon
(I see)

Bob White
He's gonna ball it up tonight
Oh, he's in there
Guy whistles pretty
Yeah, like a bird, what?

Here's a wire from the Albatross
(Sounds urgent)
It reads, 'Robin is still the boss'
(Well, thank you very much folks)
Bob White, he was in the groove tonight
(Ha ha ha)

I quote directly from the Whoopin' Crane
He says, ""Man, it was like insane""
(He made it plain)
Bob White really fought a groovy fight
I thought I had him dead in the third round

Hey, old poppa Red Bird
Who is the head bird
Says you were in there swingin'
(He was tryin')
Even the Jackdaw
Flew out the back door
Buckin' and wingin'

You instigated such a swingin' gig
That all them quadrapeds wanna dig
(Here, here, you mean)
Here come, the moose and elk
And there goes Lawrence Welk

Bob White, Bob White, Bob White
You really sang it out tonight
(Aw, it's for the birds)                ",Bob White Lyrics

[ Mermaids ]

Come to the place where mermaids dwell
Follow the call of trumpet shells
We'll fill your sails with friendly winds
And point the way with shining fins
And you can bid your cares farewell

Come to the place where mermaids dwell
In dreams you know the way so well
For if you hope and you believe
You'll see the golden nets we weave
You'll hear the stories that we tell
Where mermaids dwell
(Where mermaids dwell)
Where mermaids dwell

There are dolphins to ride for pleasure
And starfish that twinkle all night long
Streams of pearls and sunken treasure
And a mermaid song

Come to the place where mermaids dwell
Where shimmering ocean waters swell
Where laughing children of the waves
Play hide and seek among the caves
And ride a seahorse carousel

Come to the place where mermaids dwell
(Come to the place where mermaids dwell)
In dreams you know the way so well
For if you hope and you believe
You'll see the golden nets we weave
You'll hear the magic in our spell

In these little bric-a-brac A secret's waiting to be cracked These dolls and toys confuse me so Confound it all, I love it though Simple objects, nothing more But something's hidden through a door Though I do not have the key Something's here I cannot see What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? I've read these Christmas books so many times I know the stories, and I know the rhymes I know the Christmas carols all by heart My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart As often as I've read them, something's wrong So hard to put my bony finger on Or perhaps it's really not as deep As I've been led to think Am I trying much too hard? Of course! I've been too close to see The answer's right in front of me Right in front of me It's simple, really, very clear Like music drifting in the air Invisible, but everywhere Just because I cannot see it Doesn't mean I can't believe it You know, I think this Christmas thing Is not as tricky as it seems And why should <i>they </i>have all the fun? It should belong to anyone Not anyone, in fact, but me Why, <i>I</i> could make a Christmas tree And there's no reason I can find I couldn't handle Christmas time I bet I could improve it, too And that's exactly what I'll do",Jack's Obsession

Ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me
Then good luck came a-knocking at my door
Skies were gray but they're not gray anymore

Blue skies
Smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies
Do I see

Bluebirds
Singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds
All day long

Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly

Blue days
All of them gone
Nothing but blue skies
From now on

I should care if the wind blows east or west
I should fret if the worst looks like the best
I should mind if they say it can't be true
I should smile, that's exactly what I do                ",Blue Skies Lyrics

Yes, I made the choice
For papa I will stay
But I don't deserve to lose my freedom in this way
You monster!

If you think that what you've done is right
Well then... you're a fool
Think again

Is this home?
Is this where I should learn to be happy?
Never dreamed
That a home could be
Dark and cold I was told
Every day in my childhood
Even when we grow old
Home will be where the heart is
Never were words so true
My heart's far, far away
Home is too.

Is this home?
Is this what I must learn to believe in?
Try to find something good
In this tragic place
Just in case
I should stay here forever
Held in this empty space
Oh, but that won't be easy
I know the reason why
My heart's far, far away
Home's a lie
What I'd give
To return
To the life that I knew lately
But I know that I can't
Solve my problems going back

Is this home?
Am I here for a day or forever?
Shut away from the world until
Who knows when
Oh but then
As my life has been altered once it can change again
Build higher walls around me
Change every lock and key
Nothing lasts, nothing holds all of me

My heart's far, far away
Home, and free.                ",Home Lyrics

I don't know why I scare the herring
I'm so lonely, sad and blue

Brush off your scales

So come out of your shell
And get into the swim
There's a wonderful world
Waiting for you to jump in

Just say goodbye to the dark and gloomy
Come outside where it's bright and roomy
Try your smile on someone new
And watch what it can do

And you see things as they really are

But I met you and now I find
There's green in the grass
There's gold in the moon

That semi-circle that was always hanging about
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow
And you brought the colors out

Believe me it's really true
Till I met you I never knew

I never knew there were such lovely colors
And the big surprise
Is the red in your cheeks

And they'll all want lifts to Brown's Hotel

Do you hear that whistle down the line?
I figure that it's engine number forty-nine
She's the only one that'll sound that way

some enchanted evening you may see a stranger you may see a stranger across a crowded room and somehow you know you know even then that somehow you'll see here again and again some enchanted evening someone may be laughing you may hear her laughing across a crowded room and night after night as strange as it seems the sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams who can explain it who can tell you why fools give you reasons wise men never try some enchanted evening when you find your true love when you hear her call you across a crowded room then fly to her side and make her your own or all through your life you may dream all alone once you have found her never let her go once you have found her never let her go,1,Richard Rodgers,1,0,"
                    Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.                ",Some Enchanted Evening Lyrics

                    There's a party here in Agrabah
There's excitement in the air
People pouring in from near and far
'Cause Jasmine and Aladdin are gonna have a weddin'

There's a party here in Agrabah
Ev'rybody will be there
So if you're a pouper or a shah
Do something wilh your hair!

You mustn't wear an outfit that's naughty
A turban that's unravelling just won't do
No earrings that are taste|ess or gaudy
You're gonna |ook gorgeous when I get through
There's a party here in Agrabah
So I'm goin' to paint the town
If you want to see what colors are
Follow me around

Aladdin's gettin' married
And it's gonna be the wedding of the century
My buddy's gettin' married and you're gonna see
Just how much I can do

You've heard of your Safari Bar Mitzvahs
You've all been to a luau sweetsixteen
Well none of them compare to what this is
The food'll be disgusting, by evening you'll be bursting

There's a party here in Agrabah
And it's got us all aglow
If a street rat could have come so far
Maybe I could do it
Sure, there's nothin' to it

There's a party here in Agrabah
But we're not sure that we'll go
For although the bride is ladidah
The groom is awfully low

Now we take you down to the palace
Where ev'ryone has celebrated all night long
Without Jafar and all of his malice
Ev'rybody is happy! What could possibly go wrong?

There's a party here in Agrabah
And we're gonna rob'em blind
While they're all munching caviar
Create a small disturbance
I'll sneak up flom behind

There's a party here in Agrabah
And the loot is pouring in
I like this wedding stuff so far
Maybe if I'm pleasant I'll get to keep a present

We've ordered just a few tasteful flowers
And valets who will carefully park for you
The brides maids have been dressing for hours
Girls you look just lovely and so grown up too

There's a party here in Agrabah
Guests are filling up the room
But there's something missing, Yes, a-ha!
Where is the groom?                ",There's A Party Here In Agrabah 1 Lyrics

My bluebird flutters away

Ma chere, Mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight.
And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents - your dinner!

Be our guest! Be our guest!
Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie
And we'll provide the rest
Soup du jour
Hot hors d'oeuvres
Why, we only live to serve
Try the gray stuff
It's delicious!

Don't believe me? Ask the dishes!
They can sing, they can dance
After all, Miss, this is France
And a dinner here is never second best
Go on, unfold your menu
Take a glance and then you'll
Be our guest
Oui, our guest
Be our guest!

LUMIERE AND CHORUS

Beef ragout
Cheese souffle
Pie and pudding ""en flambe""

LUMIERE

We'll prepare and serve with flair
A culinary cabaret!
You're alone
And you're scared
But the banquet's all prepared
No one's gloomy or complaining
While the flatware's entertaining
We tell jokes!
I do tricks
With my fellow candlesticks

CHORUS

And it's all in perfect taste
That you can bet
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass
To be out guest

LUMIERE

If you're stressed
It's fine dining we suggest

CHORUS

Be our guest! Be our guest! Be our guest!

LUMIERE

Life it so unnerving
For a servant who's not serving
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon
Ahh those good ol' days when we were useful
Suddenly those good ol' days are gone
10 years we've been rusting
Needing so much more than dusting
Needing exercise, a chance to use our skill
Most days we just lay around the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy you walked in and oopsie daisy

MRS. POTTS

It's a guest! It's a guest!
Sakes alive, well I'll be blessed!
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed
With dessert, she'll want tea
And my dear that's fine with me
While the cups do their soft-shoein'
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing
I'll get warm, piping hot
Heaven's sakes! Is that a spot?
Clean it up! We want the company impressed

We've got a lot to do!

Is it one lump or two?
For you, our guest!

And we're obsessed
With your meal, with your ease

While the candlelight's still glowing

Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?

Under the sea, under the sea
Darling it's better down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we're devoting full time to floating
Under the sea, ha ha...

Down here all the fish is happy
And soft through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad 'cause they in the bowl!
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who goin' be on the plate?

Wo-no, under the sea

Nobody beat us, fry us and eat us

The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass and they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul (yeah)
The ray, he can play the Ling's on the strings

The Stout and the Sprat
They know where it's at
They know that blowfish blow!

When the sardine begin to beguine
It's music to me (music is to me)

last night i started out happy last night my heart was so gay last night i found myself dancing in my favorite cabaret you were completely forgotten just an affair of the past then suddenly something happened to me and i found my heart beating oh so fast i saw you last night and got that old feeling when you came in sight i got that old feeling the moment that you danced by i felt a thrill and when you caught my eye my heart stood still once again i seemed to feel that old yearning and i knew the spark of love was still burning there'll be no new romance for me it's foolish to start for that old feeling is still in my heart i saw you last night and got that old feeling when you came in sight i got that old feeling the moment that you danced by i felt a thrill and when you caught my eye my heart stood still once again i seemed to feel that old yearning and i knew the spark of love was still burning there'll be no new romance for me it's foolish to start for that old feeling is still in my heart,1,Fats Waller,1,0,"
                    Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart                ",That Old Feeling Lyrics

                    Once I loved such a shattering physician,
Quite the best looking doctor in the state,
He looked after my physical condition
And his bedside manner was great!

When I'd gaze up and see him there above me,
Looking less like a doctor than a Turk,
I was tempted to whisper, ""Do you love me,
Or do you merely love your work?""

He said my bronchial tubes were entrancing,
My epiglottis filled him with glee,
He simply loved my larynx
And went wild about my pharynx,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my epidermis was darling
And found my blood as blue as can be,
He went through wild ecstatics
About my lymphatics,
But he never said he loved me.

And though, no doubt, it was not very smart of me,
I get on a-wracking of my soul,
to figure out why he loved every part of me,
And yet not me as a whole.

By my esophagus he was ravished,
Enthusiastic to a degree,
He said 'twas just enormous,
My appendix vermiformis,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my cerebellum was brilliant,
And my cererum far from N G,
I know he thought a lotta
My medulla oblogota,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my maxillaries were marvels,
And found my sternum stunning to see,
He did a double hurdle
When I shook my pelvic girdle,
But he never said he loved me.

He seemed amused,
When he first made a test of me
To further his medical art;
Yet he refused,
When he's fixed up the rest of me,
To cure that ache in my heart.

I know he thought my pancreas perfect,
And for my spleen was keen as can be,
He said, of all his sweeties,
I'd the sweetest diabetes,
But he never said he loved me.                ",The Physician Lyrics

Yes, and the night falls on the setting sun
They massacred the buffalo

The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little room at the top of the stairs
With an Indian rug and a pipe to share
I wish a was a trapper
I would give thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And to find out how she felt
In the morning on the fields of green

Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you
just one look at you my heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone bring out the gypsy in me

I love all the many charms about you
above all i want my arms about
Don't be a naughty baby...
come to papa come to papa do

My sweet embraceable you...                ",Embraceable You Lyrics

                    I hate men.
I can't abide them even now and then.
Then ever marry one of them, I'd rest a maiden rather,
For husbands are a boring lot that only give you bother.
Of course, I'm awful glad that mother had to marry father,
Still, I hate men.
Of all the types of men I've met in our democracy,
I hate the most the athlete with his manner bold and brassy.
He may have hair upon his chesst, but sister, so has Lassie!
Oh, I hate men!
I hate men.
There worth upon this earth I can not tend
Avoid the traffic sales men atempting Tom he maybe
From China he will bring you jade and perfume from Arabi
But don't forget tis he wholl have the fun and be the baby
Oh I Hate men
If thou shouldst wed a business man, be wary, oh be wary:
He'll tell you he's detained in town on business neccesary.
The business is the business that he gives his secretary!
Oh, I hate men!
I hate men.
Though roosters they, I will not play the hen.
If you espouse an older man through girlish optimism,
He'll always stay at home and night and make no criticism.
Though you may call it love, the doctors call it rheumatism.
Oh, I hate men!
Of all I've read, alone in bed, from A to Zed about 'em,
Since love is blind, then from the mind, all womankind should rout 'em.
But, ladies, you must answer too, what would we do without 'em?
Still, I hate men!                ",I Hate Men Lyrics

                    Up a lazy river by the old mill run
Lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger awhile in the shade of the tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me

You know, before your sister was born
This is what your Mama did for a living
Music opened a whole new world to me
No matter how bad I feel, no matter how sad or sick I am
I just touched these keys and poof, like magic
I always seemed to feel better
I've always known you had talent, Bobbie
This piano is for you, Charlie worked hard for it
See God wouldn't have made you suffer so much
If you weren't gonna make up for it later

How happy you can be
Up a lazy river with me

Throw away your troubles, baby
Dream a dream with me

Up a lazy river with me

From the halfway mark

To be a star, a big star
You gotta be talented obviously
You gotta be tenacious, have charisma
But most importantly, you've gotta have it
A great intangible and you've got it all, Bobbie
You're gonna be bigger than Sinatra
I'd settle for a little Jolson Mama, Mama, Mama

Ah ah ah, there are blue skies up above
Forever long as we're in love
We'll be up a lazy river
Up a crazy lazy river
Up a lazy river
I ain't goin' your way
Get out of my way
Up a lazy river with me

And you'll look at me adoringly

This time the dream's on me

It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon

To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true, but
This time the dream's on me

It can't be true, but,
This time the dream's on me.

It would be fun

I have an ear for music, and I have an eye for a maid
I like a pretty girlie, with each pretty tune that's played
They go together
Like sunny weather
Goes with the month of May
I've studied girls and music, so I'm qualified to say

[Chorus]
A pretty girl is like a melody
That haunts you night and day
Just like the strain
Of a haunting [Refrain]
She'll start upon a marathon and run around your brain
You can't escape she's in your memory
By morning, night and noon
She will leave you and then
Come back again
A pretty girl is just like a pretty tune                ",A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody Lyrics
