Harold Arlen,Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive Lyrics,"
                    Gather 'round me, everybody
Gather 'round me, while I preach some
Feel a sermon coming on here
The topic will be sin
And that's what I'm agin'
If you wanna hear my story
Then settle back and just sit tight
While I start reviewing
The attitude of doing right

You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister inbetween

You got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
And have faith, or pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene

To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale, noah in the ark,
What did they do, just when everything looked so dark?
Man, they said, we better

Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister inbetween                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/harold+arlen/ + /h/harold+arlen/ac+cent+tchu+ate+the+positive_20064343.html
Harold Arlen,As Long As I Live Lyrics,"
                    Maybe I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Life isn't long enough baby, but I can love you as long as I live.

Maybe I can't give you diamonds and things like I want to,
But I can promise you, baby, I'm gonna want to as long as I live.

I never cared, but now I'm scared, I won't live long enough.
That's why I wear my rubbers when it rains and eat an apple every day then see
The doctor anyway.

What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.



I'll even wear long underwear, when winter breezes blow
I'm gonna take good care of me because, a sneeze or two might mean the flu,
And that would never never do

What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.

But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more

And he's right

In some big towns an' heard me some big talk, but there is one thing I know

I'm not too good at leavin' time.
I got no taste for grievin' time. No, no - not me.

Another love, a different kind, but it came to be.

Well, if you think I'm tellin' you lies,
Go try your luck and look into her eyes.
But remember, you must remember she's mine,
And my world over head has a clear new shine.

Don't want to leave you, sorry to grieve you.

Found the girl to lean upon.
And if I could arrange it,
Oh would I care to change it? Not me!

Take that moon wrap it in cellophane

Moon and June and roses and rainbow's ends
Down with songs that moan about night and day

Down with sighs and down with cupid

It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...

Here's to my first romance - ages ago
Here's to the boys I've kissed, and to complete the list
Here's to the boys who said ""no!""

Love, love, hooray for love
Who was ever too blase for love
Make this the night for love
If we have to fight, let's fight for love

Some sigh and cry for love
Ah, but in pa-ree they die for love
Some waste away for love
Just the same - hooray for love!



It's the rocket to the moon, with a touch of ""clare de lune""
It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...

Some trust to fate for love,
Others have to take off weight for love
Some go berzerk for love
Loafers even go to work for love

Sad songs are sobbed for love
People have their noses bobbed for love
Some say we pay for love

Lyrics by E. Y. (yip) harburg

I never feel a thing is real
When I'm away from you
Out of your embrace
The world's a temporary parking place

Mmm, mm, mm, mm
A bubble for a minute
Mmm, mm, mm, mm
You smile, the bubble has a rainbow in it

Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a barnum and bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe

There were millions on the floor
When a knock came on the door,
And there stood old smoky joe.

He was sweatin', cold and pale,
He was lookin' for his frail,
He was broke and all his junk ran out;
Nobody made a sound,
As he stood and looked around,
And then you hear old smoky shout:

Saying, ""tell me where is minnie?
My poor minnie!
Has she been here,
Kicking the gong around? ""

""if you don't know minnie,
She's tall and skinny,
She gets her pleasure
Kicking the gong around!""

Was here and had to go.""

You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

And never further south than the aquarium
I've seen the charm of jersey city, but first let me remark
I saw it from the empire state solarium

But we've been putting nickels in the postal savings bank
And when those nickels pile up, we can toddle off in swank
And I don't mean an ordinary cook's tour
I mean a cabin de-luxe tour

Someday we'll go places
New lands and new faces
The day we quit punching the clock
The future looks pleasant,
But at present
Let's take a walk around the block.

You're just the companion
I want at grand canyon
For throwing old blades down the rock
The money we have'll go for travel
Meantime, let's walk around the block.

Gangway, we'll begin
When our, ship comes in
I'll sit on your lap
All over the map

To london in may time
To venice in play time
To paris in time for a frock
To boston in bean time
Darling, meantime
Let's take a walk around the block.

[Bridge:]

In winter at christmas,
We'll visit the isthmus
And see how they lock up a lock
And then in caracas, on a jackass,
We'll take a ride around the block.

We'll keep to our promise,
To visit st. Thomas
And then at jamaica we'll dock
The prospect is thrilling,
Still I am willing,
Just now to talk around the block.

Onward, to cathay
Then to mandalay
Boom on to bangkok
P'r'aps vladivostok

We'll send the folks cables
Accumulate labels
Buy souvenirs till we're in hock
But since we are flat in old manhattan
Let's take a walk around the block.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/harold+arlen/ + /h/harold+arlen/lets+take+a+walk+around+the+block_20064370.html

And I've got a lot of things I'd like to say
And if I'm gloomy, please listen to me

Anxious to close
Thanks for the cheer

Step into the sun, step into the light.
Keep straight ahead for the most glorious place on the face of the earth or the

Hold onto your breath, hold onto your heart, hold onto your hope,
March up to that gate and bid it open.

Harold Arlen,Out Of This World Lyrics,"
                    You're clear out of this world
When I'm looking at you
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew

You're right out of a book
The fairy tale I read when I was five
No armored knight out of a book
Was more enchanted by a loralei
Then I

After waiting so long
For the right time
After reaching so long for a star
All at once from long and lonely night time
And despite time, here you are

I cry, ""out of this world""
If you said we were through
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two
With you                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/harold+arlen/ + /h/harold+arlen/out+of+this+world_20064338.html
Harold Arlen,Over The Rainbow Lyrics,"
                    Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a place that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Some day I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh why can't i?

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow why
Oh why can't i?                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/harold+arlen/ + /h/harold+arlen/over+the+rainbow_20064359.html

Although you're sad my heart

Remember, love is not an easy game
No two hearts ever beat quite the same

Go on and dance my heart
Our only chance my heart

Should you despair my heart

And we'll regret it

No power on earth can make it so

What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?

Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow

Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue

There's no sun up in the sky

Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together

So weary all of the time

The blues walked in and met me

The lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone

Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all of the time

Heavy-hearted and sad
Night comes around
And I'm still feeling bad
Rain pourin' down
Blinding every hope I had
This pitter 'n patter 'n beatin' 'n spatterin' drivin' me mad

Love, love, love, love
This misery will be the end of me

That old black magic that you weave so well
Icy fingers up
And down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

The same old tingle that I feel
Inside
When that elevator starts it's ride
Down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf that's
Caught in the tide

I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with
Such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You are the lover that I've waited for

The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Baby down and down I go,
All around I go
In a spin, loving the spin that I'm in
Under that old black magic called love                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/harold+arlen/ + /h/harold+arlen/that+old+black+magic_20064362.html
Harold Arlen,The Man That Got Away Lyrics,"
                    The night is bitter,
The stars have lost their glitter,
The winds grow colder,
And suddenly you're older
And all because of
The man that got away.

No more his eager call,
The writing's on the wall,
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.
The man that won you
Has run off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen it's final inning,
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game.

No more that all-time thrill
For you've been through the mill,
And never a new love will
Be the same.

Good riddance, good-bye.
Every trick of his you're on to -
But fools will be fools and where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher,
It's lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up,
Tomorrow he may turn up.
There's just no letup
The livelong night and day.

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman
Looking for the man that got away . . .

Suddenly the cyclone came, I'll never be the same

Ain't these tears in these eyes telling you
How can you ask me am I blue
Why, wouldn't you be too
If each plan with your woman
Done fell through

So big and fat that when you hug her
You don't know where you're at
You have to take a piece of chalk in your hand
And hug a way and chalk a mark
To see where you began

One day when I was a huggin' and a chalkin'
And a chalkin' and a huggin' a way
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' around the other way 'round the mountain
Comin' around the other way

Nobody ever said I'm weak
My bones don't ache and my joints creak
But I, I grow absolutely limp
Every time I kiss my baby blimp, oh

One day I had a yen for some one leaner, she was meaner than a
Mink in a pen. So I left her now I'm happy as a fella could be
Huggin' and chalkin' in once a gain 'round my Rosie
Huggin' and chalkin' in once again

One day I was a huggin' and a chalkin' and a beggin' her to be my bride

Hoagy Carmichael,I Want To Be Happy Lyrics,"
                    I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

When skies are gray and you say you are blue

Lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger awhile in the shade of the tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me

You know, before your sister was born
This is what your Mama did for a living
Music opened a whole new world to me
No matter how bad I feel, no matter how sad or sick I am
I just touched these keys and poof, like magic
I always seemed to feel better
I've always known you had talent, Bobbie
This piano is for you, Charlie worked hard for it
See God wouldn't have made you suffer so much
If you weren't gonna make up for it later

How happy you can be
Up a lazy river with me

Throw away your troubles, baby
Dream a dream with me

Up a lazy river with me

From the halfway mark

To be a star, a big star
You gotta be talented obviously
You gotta be tenacious, have charisma
But most importantly, you've gotta have it
A great intangible and you've got it all, Bobbie
You're gonna be bigger than Sinatra
I'd settle for a little Jolson Mama, Mama, Mama

Ah ah ah, there are blue skies up above
Forever long as we're in love
We'll be up a lazy river
Up a crazy lazy river
Up a lazy river
I ain't goin' your way
Get out of my way
Up a lazy river with me

But baby I'm switchin' to another line
So honey, never hang your single out for me
I'm tired of running on the same old track
Bought a one way ticket and I won't be back
This Golden Rocket is gonna roll my blues away

Hear that lonesome whistle blow
That's your cue and by now you know
That I've got another true love waitin' in Tennessee
This midnight special is burning the rails
So woman don't try to follow my trail
This Golden Rocket is gonna roll my blues away

Hear her thunder on through the night
This Golden Rocket is a-doin' me right
That sunny old southland sure is a part of me
Now from your call-board erase my name
Your fire done went out you done lost your flame
And this Golden Rocket is a-rollin' my blues away

That old conductor he seemed to know 
You've done me wrong I was feeling low 
For he yelled aloud we're over that Dixon Line
The Brakeman started singin' a song 
Said 'You're worried now, but it won't be long'
'This Golden Rocket is leavin' your blues behind'

Then the Porter yelled with his southern drawl, 
'Let's rise and shine.  Good mornin' you all'
And I sprang to my feet to greet the newborn day
When I kissed my baby in the station door
That whistle blew like it never before
On the Golden Rocket that rolled my blues away                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/hoagy+carmichael/ + /h/hoagy+carmichael/the+golden+rocket_21216301.html
Hoagy Carmichael,The Lamplighter's Serenade Lyrics,"
                    A moment after dark around the park
An old-fashion gent comes parading
Dressed in funny clothes but singing as he goes
The Lamplighter's Serenade

The old boy loves to talk with couples on the walk
But when it's half after love time
He reaches for his sticks and from his bag of tricks
He lights every star in the sky

And if a lady or a beau should answer no
He sprinkles their hearts with his magic
Then he steals away to sing another day
The Lamplighter's Serenade

The old boy loves to talk with the couples on the walk
But when it's half after love time
He reaches for his sticks and from his bag of tricks
He lights every star in the sky

And if a lady or a beau should answer no
He sprinkles their hearts with his magic
Then he steals away to sing another day

That thrills and delights me, oh no

It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
It's just the nearness of you

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true

I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night the nearness of you                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/hoagy+carmichael/ + /h/hoagy+carmichael/the+nearness+of+you_20735307.html
Hoagy Carmichael,The Old Music Master Lyrics,"
                    One night long ago by the light of the moon,
An old music master sat composing a tune,
His spirit was soaring and his heart full of joy,
When right out of nowhere stepped a little colored boy.
You gotta jump it, music master,
You gotta play that rhythm faster,
You're never gonna get it played
On the Happy Cat Hit Parade.
You better tell your friend Beethoven,
And Mister Reginald De Koven
They better do the same as you,
Or they're gonna be corny too.
Long about nineteen seventeen
Jazz'll come upon the scene,
Then about nineteen thirty-five
You'll begin to hear swing,
Boogie Woogie and Jive,
You gotta show that big broadcaster
That you're a solid music master,
And you'll achieve posterity,
That's a bit of advice from me.
The old music master simply sat there amazed,
As wide-eyed and open-mouthed he gazed and he gazed
How can you be certain little boy, tell me how?
Because I was born, my friend,
A hundred years from now.
He hit a chord that rocked the spinet
And disappeared into the infinite,
And up until the present day,
You can take it from me,
He's as right as can be,
Ev'rything has happened that-a-way.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/hoagy+carmichael/ + /h/hoagy+carmichael/the+old+music+master_21214285.html

To the place where Louie dwells
To the dear old Temple bar we love so well

And the magic of their singing casts it's spell

Yes, the magic of their singing of the songs we love so well
""Shall I Wasting"" and ""Mavourneen"" and the rest
We will serenade our Louie while life and voice shall last
Then we'll pass and be forgotten with the rest

We're poor little lambs who have lost our way
Baa, baa, baa
We're little black sheep who have gone astray

Out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning
Look how late it gets

Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight

Here we are
In the cozy chair
Pickin' on a wishbone
From the frigid air

Two sleepy people with nothing to say
And too much in love to break away

Do you remember
The nights we used to linger in the hall?
Your father didn't like me at all

Do you remember
The reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest

Well, here we are
Just about the same
Foggy little fella
Drowsy little dame

Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight

Oscar Hammerstein,A Puzzlement Lyrics,"
                    When I was a boy
World was better spot.
What was so was so, 
What was not was not.
Now I am a man; 
World have changed a lot.
Some things nearly so, 
Others nearly not.

There are times I almost think
I am not sure of what I absolutely know.
Very often find confusion
In conclusion I concluded long ago
In my head are many facts T
Hat, as a student, I have studied to procure, 
In my head are many facts... 
Of which I wish I was more certain I was sure! 

[Spoken:] Is a puzzlement
What to tell growing son
What for instance, shall I say to him of women?
Shall I educate him on the ancient lines?
Shall I tell the boy as far as he is able, 
To respect his wives and love his concubines?
Shall I tell him everyone is like the other, 
And the better of the two is really neither?
If I tell him this I think he won't believe it-
And I nearly think that I don't believe it either! 

When my father was a king
He was a king who knew exactly what he knew, 
And his brain was not a thing
Forever swinging to and fro and fro and to.
Shall I, then be like my father
And be willfully unmoveable and strong?
Or is it better to be right?... 
Or am I right when I believe I may be wrong?
Shall I join with other nations in alliance?
If allies are weak, am I not best alone?
If allies are strong with power to protect me, 
Might they not protect me out of all I own?
Is a danger to be trusting one another, 
One will seldom want to do what other wishes; 
Bul unless someday somebody trust somebody
There'll be nothing left on earth exceot fishes! 

There are times I almost think
Nobody sure of what he absolutely know.
Everybody find confusion
In conclusion he concluded long ago
And it puzzle me to learn
That tho' a man may be in doubt of what he know, 
Very quickly he will fight... 
He'll fight to prove that what he does not know is so! 
Oh-h-h-h-h-h Sometimes I think that people going mad! 
Ah-h-h-h-h-h! Sometimes I think that people not so bad! 
But no matter what I think I must go on living life.
As leader of my kingdom I must go forth, 
Be father to my children and husband to each wife
Excetera, excetera, and so forth.
If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way! 
Everyday I try to live another day. If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the
Way! 
Everyday I do my best for one-more day!

Oscar Hammerstein,All Er Nothin' Lyrics,"
                    You'll have to be a little more standoffish
When fellers offer you a buggy ride

I'll give an imitation of a crawfish
And dig myself a hole where I can hide

I heard how you was kicken' up some capers
When I was off in Kansas City, Mo.
I heard some things you couldn't print in papers
From fellers who been talkin' like they know! 

Foot! 
I only did the kind of things I orta, sorta
To you I was as faithful as can be, for me
Them stories 'bout the way I lost my bloomers-rumors! 
A lot of tempest in a pot o' tea! 

The whole don't sound very good to me.

Well, you see

I go and sow my last wild oat
I cut out all shenanigans
I save my money, don't gamble or drink
In the back room down at Flannigans! 
I give up lotsa other things
A gentleman never mentions
But before I give up any more
I wanna know your intentions! 

With me, it's all er nuthin'
Is it all or nuthin' with you?
It cain't be in between
It can't be now and then
No half and half romance will do! 

I'm a one woman man, home lovin' type
All complete with slippers and pipe
Take me like I am er leave me be! 
If you can't give me all, give me nuthin'
And nuthin's what you'll git from me

Not even somethin'

Nuthin's what you'll git from me! 

It cain't be in between

Nnn-mmm

It cain't be now and then

No half and half romance will do

Would you build me a house
All painted white
Cute and clean and purty and bright

Big enough fer two but not fer three! 

Suposin' that we should have a third one

He'd better look a lot like me

No spittin' image

He'd better look a lot like me! 

With you it's all er nuthin'
All fer you and nothin' fer me
But if a wife is wise, she's gotta realize
That men like you are wild and free

So I ain't gonna fuss, ain't gonna frown
Have your fun, go out on the town
Stay up late and don't come home til three! 
And go right off to sleep if you're sleepy
There's no use waitin' up fer me

Oh, Ado Annie! 

No use waitin' up fer me!

                    When I think of Tom.
I think of a night,
When the earth smelled of summer
And the sky was streaked with white,
The soft mist of England
Was sleeping on a hill.

I remember this,
And I always will...
There are new lovers now
On the same silent hill,
Looking on the same blue sea.
And I know Tom and I are a part of them all--
And they're all a part of Tom and me.

Hello young lovers, whoever you are,
I hope your troubles are few.
All my good wishes go with you tonight,
I've been in love like you.

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star,
Be brave and faithful and true,
Cling very close to each other tonight.
I've been in love like you.

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels,
And to fly down the street in a trance.
You fly down a street on the chance that you meet,
And you meet--not really by chance.

Don't cry young lovers, whatever you do,
Don't cry because I'm alone;
All of my memories are happy tonight,
I've had a love of my own.
I've had a love of my own, like yours-
I've had a love of my own.

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star,
Be brave and faithful and true,
Cling very close to each other tonight.
I've been in love like you.

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels,
And to fly down the street in a trance.
You fly down a street on the chance that you meet,
And you meet--not really by chance.

Don't cry because I'm alone;

                    It ain't so much a question of knowin' what to do
I knowed what's right an' wrong since I've been ten
I've heard a lot of stories and I reckon they're true
About how girls are put upon by men
I know I musn't fall into the pit
But when I'm with a feller
I ferget!

I'm just a girl who cain't say no
I'm in a terrible fix
I always say 'come on, let's go'
Just when I oughta say 'nix'

When a person tries to kiss a girl
I know she oughta give his face a smack!
But as soon as someone kisses me
I somehow sorta want to kiss him back!

I'm just a fool when lights are low
I cain't be prissy an' quaint
I ain't the type that can faint
How can I be what I ain't
I cain't say no

Watcha gonna do when a feller gets flirty
And starts to talk purty
Whatcha gonna do?
Supposin that he says
Your lips are like cherries
Or roses or berries
Whatcha gonna do?

Supposin that he says
That yer sweeter than cream
And he's gotta have cream or die
Whatcha gonna do when he talks that way?
Spit in his eye?

I'm just a girl who cain't say no
Cain't seem to say it at all
I hate to disserpoint a beau
When he is payin' a call!

Fer a while I act refined and cool
A settin on the velveteen setee
Then I think of that ol' golden rule
And do fer him what he would do fer me

I cain't resist a Romeo
In a sombero and chaps
Soon as I sit on their laps
Somethin' inside of me snaps
I cain't say no!

I'm just a girl who cain't say no
Kissin's my favorite food
With or without the mistletoe
I'm in a holiday mood!

Other girls are coy and hard to catch
But other girls ain't havin' any fun
Every time I lose a wrastlin' match
I have a funny feeling that I won

Though I can feel the undertoe
I never make a complaint
'Till it's too late for restraint
Then when I want to I cain't
I cain't say no!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/o/oscar+hammerstein/ + /o/oscar+hammerstein/i+caint+say+no_20907422.html

I will answer too
That means I offer my love to you
If you refuse it I will be blue
And waiting all alone
But if when you hear my love call ringing clear
And I hear your love call echoing so near
Then I know our love will come true

Oscar Hammerstein,Kansas City Lyrics,"
                    I got to Kansas City on a Firday
By Saturday I learned a thing or two
Cuz up to then I didn't have an idy
Of whut the modern world was comin' to!

I counted twenty gas buggies goin' by their sels
Almost every time I took a walk
Then I put my ear to a bell telephone
And a strange woman started in to talk

To you?

What next?

Yeah what?

What next?
Gather round!

Everythin's up to date in Kansas City
They've gone about as fur as they can go
They went and built a skyscraper seven stories high
About as high as a buildin' oughta grow
Everythin's like a dream in Kansas City
It's better than a magic lantren show
You can turn the radiator on
Whenever you want some heat
With every kind of comfort
Every house is all complete
You can walk to privies in the rain
And never wet your feet!
They've gone about as fur as they can go

Yes sir!
They've gone about as fur as they can go

Everythin's up to date in Kansas City
They've gone about as fur as they can go
They've got a big theyater they call a burleeque
For fifty cents you can see a dandy show

Gals?

One of the gals was fat and pink and pretty
As round above as she was round below
I could swear that she was padded
From her shoulder to her heel
But latter in the second act
When she began to peel
She proved that everyhin' she had was absolutely real!
She went about as fur as she can go

Yes sir!
She went about as fur as she can go!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/o/oscar+hammerstein/ + /o/oscar+hammerstein/kansas+city_20907440.html

Oscar Hammerstein,Many A New Day Lyrics,"
                    Why should a woman who is healthy and strong
Blubber like a baby cause her man's gone away
A weepin' and a whalin' that he's done her wrong
That's one thing you'll never hear me say!
Never gonna think that the man I lose
Is the only man among men!
I'll snap my fingers to show I don't care
I'll buy me a brand new dress to wear
I'll scrub my neck
And I'll brush my hair
And start all over again

Many a new face will please my eye
Many a new love will find me
Never have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind me
Many a new day will dawn before I do

Many a like lad may kiss and fly
A kiss gone is bygone
Never have I asked an August sky
'Where has last July gone? '
Never have I wondered through the rye
Wondering where has some guy gone
Many a new day will dawn before I do

Many a new face will please my eye
Many a new love will find me
Never have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind me
Many a new day will dawn before I do!

Never have I chased the honeybee
Who carelessly conjoled me
Somebody just as sweet as he
Cheered me and consoled me
Never have I wept into my tea
Over the deal someone doled me

Many a new day will dawn

Many a red sun will set
Many a blue moon will shine
Before I do!

Many a new face will please my eye
Many a new love will find me
Never have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind me
Many a new day will dawn before I do!

Never have I chased the honeybee
Who carelessly conjoled me
Somebody just as sweet as he
Cheered me and consoled me
Many a new day will dawn

Many a red sun will set
Many a blue moon will shine

Soft and slim, 
Painted cheek, 
Tap'ring limb, 
Smiling lips

Eyes that shine
Just for him-
So he thinks... 

Just for him!

They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by
But a little brown maverick is winkin' her eye

The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree
And an old weepin' willer is laughin' at me!

When the mist is low
And stars are breaking through
Then out of your dreams you'll go
Into a dream come true

Make up your mind, make up your mind laurie

Make up your own, make up your own story, laurie dear

Old pharaoh's daughter won't tell you, what do do
But your heart, whatever it tells you will be true

Out of my dreams and into his arms I long to fly
I will come as evening comes into a waiting sky

When the mist is low
And starts are breaking through

Why do the neighbors gossip all day behind their doors?

A practical list of don'ts fer you

Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much

Laughs at your jokes-

Don't sigh and gaze at me

Your eyes musn't glow like mine

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove
Sweetheart, they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love!

Some people claim that you're to blame as much as I
Why do you take the trouble to bake my favorite pie?
Grantin' your wish, I carved our initals on that tree
Just keep a slice of all the advice you give so free

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Poor Jud Fry is daid
All gather round his coffin now and cry
He had a heart of gold
And he wasn't very old
Oh why did such a fella have to die

Poor Jud is daid
Poor Jud Fry is daid
He's looking oh so peaceful and serene

And serene!

He's all laid down to rest
With his hands across his chest
His fingernails have never looked so clean

And then the preacher'd get up and he'd say: ""Folks, we are gathered
Here to mourn and growl our brother Jud Fry, who hung himself up
By a rope in a smokehouse, and then we have been weepin' and
Wailin' within some of the women. "" And then he'd say: ""Jud was the
Most misunderstood man in the territory. People used to think he was
A mean, ugly fella and they called him a dirty skunk and a northern
Pig stealer.

But the folks that really knowed 'I'm
Knowed that neath those dirty shirts he always wore
There beated a heart as big as all outdoors

As big as all outdoors

Jud Fry loved his fellow man

He loved his fellow man

He loved the birds of the forest
And the bees of the field
He loved the mice and the vermin in the barn
And he treated the rats like equals, which he knew was right!
And he loved the little children
He loved everybody and everything in the world
Only he never let on, so nobody ever noticed

Poor Jud is Daid
Poor Jud Fry is daid
His friends all weep and wail from miles around

Miles around!

The daisies in the dell will give out a different smell
Because poor Jud is underneath the ground

Poor Jud is daid, the candle lights his head
He's layin' in a coffin made of wood

Wood

And folks are feelin' sad cause they used to treat him bad
Now they know their friend has gone for good

Good

Poor Jud is daid, a candle lights his head
He's lookin oh so pretty and so nice
He looks like he's asleep
It's a shame that he won't keep
But it's summer and we're runinng out of ice

Oscar Hammerstein,Shall I Tell You What I Think Of You? Lyrics,"
                    Your servant! Your servant!
Indeed I'm not your servant --
Although you give me less than servant's pay --
I'm a free and independent employe
[Pronounced ""employay""]... (sigh) employee.

Because I'm a woman
You think, like ev'ry woman
I have to be a slave or concubine.
You conceited, self-indulgent libertine!... (sigh)
Libertine! [pronounced ""liberteen""]

How I wished I called him that!
Right to his face! Libertine!
And while we're on the subject, sire,
There are certain goings on around this place
That I wish to tell you I do not admire:
I do not like polygamy
Or even moderate bigamy
I realize
That in your eyes
That clearly makes a prig o' me.

But I am from a civilized land called Wales!
Where men like you are locked in county jails!
In your pursuit of pleasure, you
Have mistresses who treasure you

They have no ken of other men
Beside whom they can measure you

A flock of sheep and you're the only ram
No wonder you're the wonder of Siam!

[Spoken] I'm rather glad I didn't say that...
Not with the women right there... And the children

[Singing] The children, the children,
I'll not forget the children,
No matter where I go I'll always see
Those little faces looking up at me...

At first, when I started to teach,
They were shy and remained out of reach,
But lately I've thought
One or two have been caught
By a word I have said
Or a sentence I've read
And I've heard an occasional question
That implied, at least, a suggestion
That the work I've been trying to do
Was beginning to show with a few...

That Prince Chululongkorn
Is very like his father.
He's stubborn-but inquistitive and smart...
I must leave this place before they break my heart
I must leave this place before they break my heart!

Goodness! I had no idea it was so late.

Shall It tell you what I think of you?
You're spoiled!
You're a conscientious worker
But your spoiled.
Giving credit where it's due
There is much I like in you
But it's also very true
That your spoiled!
Everybody's always bowing to the King
Everybody has to grovel to the King.
By your Buddha you are blessed
By your ladies you're caressed,
But the one who loves you best is the King.

All that bowing and kow-towing
To remind you of your royalty,
I find a most disgusting exhibition.
I wouldn't ask a Siamese cat
To demonstrate his loyalty
By taking this ridiculous position
How would you like it if you were a man
Playing the part of a toad.
Crawling around on your elbows and knees.
Eating the dust of the road!...

Toads! Toads! All of your people are toads!
Yes, Your Majesty;
No, Your Majesty.
Tell us how low to go, Your Majesty;
Make some more decrees, Your Majesty,
Don't let us up off out knees, Your Majesty.
Give us a kick, if you please Your Majesty
Give us a kick, if you would, Your Majesty
Oh, That was good, Your Majesty!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/o/oscar+hammerstein/ + /o/oscar+hammerstein/shall+i+tell+you+what+i+think+of+you_20907452.html

So many men and girls are in each others arms
It made me think we might be similarly occupied

Shall we then say goodnight and mean goodbye
Or per chance, when the last little star has left the sky
Shall we still be together with our arms about each other
And shall you be my new romance

Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance

Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
One man likes to push a plow
The other likes to chase a cow
But that's no reason why they can't be friends

Territory folks should stick together
Territory folks should all be pals
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals

Territory folks should stick together
Territory folks should all be pals
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals!

I'd like to say a word for the farmer

Well, say it!

He come out west and made a lot of changes

That's right!

He come out west and built a lot of fences
And built 'em right across our cattle ranges!

Why don't you dirt strangers go back to Missouri Where you belong?

We got just as much right here!

Shut up!
The farmer a good in criticism
No matter what the cowman says or thinks
You seldom see 'I'm drinkin in a bar room

Unless somebody else is buying drinks!

Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
The cowman ropes a cow with ease
The farmer steals her butter and cheese
That's no reason why they can't be friends

Territory folks should stick together
Territory folks should all be pals
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals!

I'd like to say a word for the cowboy

You would!

The road he treads is difficult and stony
He rides fer days on end with just a pony for a friend

I sure am feeling sorry for the pony!

The farmer should be sociable with the cowboy
If he rides by an' asks fer food and water
Don't treat 'I'm like a louse
Make him welcome in your house

But be sure that you've locked up your wife and daughters!

(They all offend themselves at the same time and fight)

Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
One man likes to push a plow
The other likes to chase a cow
But that's no reason why they can't be friends

Gun shot

Ain't nobody gonna slug anything! This here's a party!
Break it up ya two ol' fools! Alright, Andrew, sing it.
Dum-dah-dee-um-dum-dum

Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends

Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
One man likes to push a plow
The other likes to chase a cow
But that's no reason why they can't be friends

And when this territory is a state
An' joins the Union just like all the others
The farmer, the cowman, and the merchant
Must all behave theirselves and act like brothers

I'll teach you all a little sayin'
And learn the words by heart the way you should
I don't say I'm no better than anybody else
But I'll be danged if I ain't just as good!

I don't say I'm better than anybody else

Honey, here's the way it's gonna be
You will sit behind a team of snow white horses
In the slickest gig you've ever seen

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppen strutters
Nosy pokes will peek through their shutters and their eyes will pop!

The wheels are yellow, the upholstry's brown
The dashboard's genuine leather
With eisenglass curtains you can roll right down
In case there's a change in the weather

Two bright side lights winkin' and blinkin'
Ain't no finer rig I'm a thinkin'
You can keep your rig if you're thinkin that I'd keer to swap
Fer that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top

Would you say the fringe was made of silk?
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Has it really got a team of snow white horses?
One's like snow, the other's more like milk

All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top
When we hit that road hell-for-leather
Cats and dogs will dance in the heather
Birds and frogs will sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along
The cows'll moo in the clover
The river will ripple out a whispered song
And whisper over and over
Don't you wish you'd go on forever
Don't you wish you'd go on forever
Don't you wish you'd go on forever
And you'd never stop?
In that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top

I can see the stars gettin' blurry
When we ride back home in the surrey
Ridin' slowly home on the surrey
With the fringe on top
I can feel the day gettin' older
Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder
Till it falls kerplop

The sun is swimming on the rim of a hill
The moon is taking a header
And just when I'm thinking all the earth is still
A lark'll wake up in the meader

Hush, you bird. My baby's a sleepin'
Maybe got a dream worth a keepin'
Whoa, you team and just keep a creepin'

Oscar Hammerstein,We Kiss In A Shadow Lyrics,"
                    We kiss in a shadow,
We hide from the moon,
Our meetings are few,
And over too soon.

We speak in a whisper,
Afraid to be heard;
When people are near,
We speak not a word.
Alone in our secret,
Together we sigh,
For one smiling day to be free
To kiss in the sunlight
And say to the sky;
""Behold and believe what you see!
Behold how my lover loves me! ""

[Tuptim]

We speak in a whisper,
Afraid to be heard;
When people are near,

[Lun tha]

We speak not a word.
Alone in our secret,
Together we sigh,
For one smiling day to be free

[Both]

To kiss in the sunlight
And to say to the sky;
""Behold and believe what you see!
Behold how my lover loves me! ""

Since the Puritans got a shock,
When they landed on Plymouth Rock.
If today,
Any shock they should try to stem,
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock,
Plymouth Rock would land on them.
In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking,

Good authors too who once knew better words,

Writing prose, Anything Goes.

In night clubs is getting matey with gigolo's,

If low bars you like,
If old hymns you like,
If bare limbs you like,
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like,
Why, nobody will oppose!

The set that's smart
Is intruding in nudist parties in studios,

Cole Porter,Begin The Beguine Lyrics,"
                    When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green
I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine
To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part
What moments divine, what rapture serene
The clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean
So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine
O yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more: ""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the beguine                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter//c/cole+porter/begin+the+beguine_20153583.html

Mighty low, Gabriel low,

I'm good by day and I'm good by night
So blow, Gabriel blow.

Once I was headed for hell,
Once I was headed for hell,
But when I got to Satan's door,
I heard you blowin' on your horn once more
So I said ""Satan, farewell.""

Just to fly higher and higher,
'cause I've been through brimstone,
And I've been through the fire,
And I've perched my soul,
And my heart too,
So climb up the mountain top and start to
Blow, Gabriel blow,
Go on an' blow, Gabriel blow,
I want to join your happy band,
And play all day in the promised land
So blow, Gabriel blow.

Stand up on your lazy feet and sing!

                    Oh, I'm so mad about a lad
It's too deep to express
And when he tries to use his eyes
They have instant success
So full of passion, these pupils are
That girls forget what their scruples are
So when he turns them on me
I murmur tenderly

I think you're great, I think you're grand
And I don't mind if you hold my hand
But don't look at me that way

Your kisses, too, are heavenly
And oh, so full of variety
But don't look at me that way

When you tell me sweetly you're mine completely
I always give a long cheer
But those sudden flashes behind your lashes
Are nobody's business, dear

Since you began to play your role
I've lost my heart and I've lost my soul
But as for losing my self-control
Don't look at me that way

I just adore your loving arms
In fact, they're two of your greatest charms
But don't look at me that way

I'm very mild, I'm very meek
My will is strong, but my won't is weak
So don't look at me that way

When that strange expression of indiscretion
Begins to show in your stare
There's a hocus-pocus about your focus
That gives me a terrible scare

I feel a thrill when you arrive
And while you're near I simply thrive
But if you want to get home alive

About the women and children first,
The men had much more charm than they have today.
And if only one of that type survived,
The very moment that he arrived,
I know I'd fall in love in a great big way.
I can't imagine being bad
With any Arrow collar ad,
Nor could I take the slightest joy
In waking up a college boy.
I've no desire to be alone
With Rudy Vallee's megaphone,
So when I'm saying my prayers, I say:

Find me a primitive man,
Built on a primitive plan.
Someone with vigor and vim.
I don't mean a kind that belongs to a club,
But the kind that has a club that belongs to him.
I could be the personal slave
Of someone just out of a cave.
The only man who'll ever win me
Has gotta wake up the gypsy in me,
Find me a primitive man,
Find me a primitive man.

Trouve moi un homme primitif
Trouve moi un garcon naif.
Quelqu'un tout plein de vigeur,
Ces p'tits maquereaux qu'on appelle gigolos ne
Pourraient jamais donner le vrai bonheur.
J'ai besoin d'un bel animal
Pour chauffeur mon chaffage centrale.
Et l'homme qui me veut pour capitane
Devrait reveiler mon sang tzigane,
Trouve moi un homme primitif, vif,
Trouve moi un homme primitif.

(Find me a primitive man,
Find me a forthright young lad,
Someone with vigor to spare,
Those fatuous beaux they call gigolos could never give me happiness.
I must have a gorgeous beast
To heat up my own central heat.
And he who aspires to be my stud
Must reawake my gypsy blood.

Whenever the winter winds become too strong

When fortune cries ""Nay, nay"" to me
And people declare ""You're through""
Whenever the blues become my only songs
I concentrate on you

On your smile, so sweet, so tender

When at first my kiss you do decline
On the light in your eyes when you surrender
And once again our arms intertwine

And so when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true
To prove that even the wise men can be wrong

Cole Porter,I Get A Kick Out Of You Lyrics,"
                    My story is much too sad to be told,
But practically everything
Leaves me totally cold.
The only exception I know is the case,
When I'm out on a quiet spree,
Fighting vainly the old enui
And I suddenly turn and see,
Your fabulous face.
I get no kick from Champagne
Mere alchohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick
Out of you
Some get a kick from cocain
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrificly too
Yet I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me you obviously don't
Adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high
With some guy in the sky is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick
Out of you                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter//c/cole+porter/i+get+a+kick+out+of+you_20209574.html

Cole Porter,I Hate Men Lyrics,"
                    I hate men.
I can't abide them even now and then.
Then ever marry one of them, I'd rest a maiden rather,
For husbands are a boring lot that only give you bother.
Of course, I'm awful glad that mother had to marry father,
Still, I hate men.
Of all the types of men I've met in our democracy,
I hate the most the athlete with his manner bold and brassy.
He may have hair upon his chesst, but sister, so has Lassie!
Oh, I hate men!
I hate men.
There worth upon this earth I can not tend
Avoid the traffic sales men atempting Tom he maybe
From China he will bring you jade and perfume from Arabi
But don't forget tis he wholl have the fun and be the baby
Oh I Hate men
If thou shouldst wed a business man, be wary, oh be wary:
He'll tell you he's detained in town on business neccesary.
The business is the business that he gives his secretary!
Oh, I hate men!
I hate men.
Though roosters they, I will not play the hen.
If you espouse an older man through girlish optimism,
He'll always stay at home and night and make no criticism.
Though you may call it love, the doctors call it rheumatism.
Oh, I hate men!
Of all I've read, alone in bed, from A to Zed about 'em,
Since love is blind, then from the mind, all womankind should rout 'em.
But, ladies, you must answer too, what would we do without 'em?

Cole Porter,I'm A Gigolo Lyrics,"
                    I should like you all to know,
I'm a famous gigolo.
And of lavender, my nature's got just a dash in it.
As I'm slightly undersexed,
You will always find me next
To some dowager who's wealthy rather than passionate.
Go to one of those night club places
And you'll find me stretching my braces
Pushing ladies with lifted faces 'round the floor.
But I must confess to you
There are moments when I'm blue.
And I ask myself whatever I do it for.

I'm a flower that blooms in the winter,
Sinking deeper and deeper in snow.
I'm a baby who has
No mother but jazz,
I'm a gigolo.
Ev'ry morning, when labor is over,
To my sweet-scented lodgings I go,
Take the glass from the shelf
And look at myself,
I'm a gigolo.
I get stocks and bonds
From faded blondes
Ev'ry twenty-fifth of December.
Still I'm just a pet
That men forget
And only tailors remember.
Yet when I see the way all the ladies
Treat their husbands who put up the dough,
You cannot think me odd
If then I thank God
I'm a gigolo.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter//c/cole+porter/im+a+gigolo_21149667.html

At the bottom of the dell
Starts to ring Ding dong Ding dong

In the middle of his work
Starts a tune to the moon up above

Simply telling us to fall in love

And that's why birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Cold Cape Cod clams, 'gainst their wish, do it
Even lazy jellyfish do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Layin' on a rock
They say that roosters do it
With a doodle and c***

Some Argentines, without means do it
I hear even Boston beans do it

Who has never said a word
Starts to sing Spring spring spring

At the bottom of the dell
Starts to ring Ding ding ding
When the little blue clerk
In the middle of his work
Starts a tune

The most refined lady bugs do it
When a gentleman calls
Moths in your rugs they do it
What's the use of moth balls

The chimpanzees in the zoos do it,
Some courageous kangaroos do it

Maybe even you and I might do it

Why should it make
A fool of me?
I saw you there
One wonderful day
You took my heart
And threw it away
That's why I ask the lord
In heaven above
What is this thing
Called love?
What is this thing called love
This funny thing
Called love
Just who can solve it's mystery
Why should it make
A fool of me?
I saw you there
One wonderful day
You took my heart
And threw it away
That's why I ask the lord
In heaven above
What is this thing
Called love?                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter//c/cole+porter/what+is+this+thing+called+love_20341406.html
Cole Porter,Where Is The Life That Late I Led? Lyrics,"
                    Since I reached the charming age of puberty
And began to think of feminine curls
Like a show that's typically Shuberty
I have always had a multitude of girls
But now that a married man at last am I
How aware of my dear departed past am I
Where is the life that late I led?
Where is it now? Totally dead!
Where is the fun I used to find?
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!
A married life may all be well
But raising an heir could never compare
With raising a bit of hell
So I repeat what first I said
Where is the life that late I...
In dear Milano, where are you Momo?
Still selling those pictures of the scriptures in the duomo
And Carolina, where are you, 'lina?
Still peddling your pizza in the streets-a Toremina
And in Firenze, where are you Alice?
Still there in your pretty itty-bitty pity palace
And sweet Lucretia, so young and gay
What scandalous doings in the ruins of Pompeii
Where is the life that late I led?
Where is it now? Totally dead!
Where is the fun I used to find?
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!
The marriage game is quite all right
Yes during the day it's easy to play
But oh what a bore at night
So I repeat what first I said
Where is the life that late I...
Where is Rebecca? My Becky-wecky-oh
Could still she be cruising that amusing Pontevecchio?
Where is Fedora, the wild virago?
It's lucky I missed her gangster sister from Chicago
Where is Venetia, who loved to chat so?
Could still she be drinking in her stinking pink palazzo?
And lovely Lisa, where are you Lisa?
You gave a new meaning to the Leaning Tower of Piza
Where is the life that late I led?
Where is it now? Totally dead!
Where is the fun I used to find?
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!
I've oft been told of nuptial bliss
But what do you do at quarter to two
With only a shrew to kiss?
So I repeat what first I said
Where is the life that late I led                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter//c/cole+porter/where+is+the+life+that+late+i+led_20339895.html
Cole Porter,Why Can't You Behave? Lyrics,"
                    Bill, you've been gamblin' again
Gee honey, I'm sorry
If only you meant it

Why can’t you behave?
Oh, why can’t you behave?
After all the things you told me
And the promises that you gave
Oh, why can’t you behave?

They switched the dice on me, baby

Why can’t you be good?
And do just as you should
Won't you turn that new leaf over
So your baby can be your slave?
Oh, why can’t you behave?

There’s a farm I know near my old hometown
Where we two can go and try settlin’ down
There I’ll care for you forever
Well, at least till you dig my grave, oh
Oh, why can’t you behave?

Gee, I need you kid
I always knew you did
But why can't you behave?                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter//c/cole+porter/why+cant+you+behave_20810401.html
Cole Porter,You Do Something To Me Lyrics,"
                    You Do Something To Me""
Cole Porter/Sinead O'Connor 1990

You do something to me.
Something that simply mystifies me.
Tell me, why should it be
You have the pow'are to hypnotize me.
Let me live 'neath your spell.
Do do that vodoo that you do so well.
For you do something to me
That nobody else can do.
Let me live 'neath your spell.
Do do that vodoo that you do so well
For you do something to me
That nobody else can do.
That nobody else can do                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter//c/cole+porter/you+do+something+to+me_20351771.html
Cole Porter,You're The Top Lyrics,"
                    At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed,
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty
At least it'll tell you
How great you are.

You're the top!
You're the Coliseum.
You're the top!
You're the Louver Museum.
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss
You're a Bendel bonnet,
A Shakespeare's sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile,
You're the Tower of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic.
On the other hand, babe, you shine,
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine
Down my spine.
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans
Might think that your song is bad,
But I got a notion
I'll second the motion
And this is what I'm going to add;

You're the top!
You're Mahatma Gandhi.
You're the top!
You're Napoleon Brandy.
You're the purple light
Of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gallery
You're Garbo's salary,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime,
You're turkey dinner,
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop
But if, baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top!
You're an arrow collar
You're the top!
You're a Coolidge dollar,
You're the nimble tread
Of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama,

You're Whistler's mama!

You're camembert.

You're a rose,
You're Inferno's Dante,

You're the nose
On the great Durante.
I'm just in a way,
As the French would say, ""de trop"".
But if, baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top!
You're a dance in Bali.
You're the top!
You're a hot tamale.
You're an angel, you,
Simply too, too, too diveen,
You're a Boticcelli,
You're Keats,
You're Shelly!

You're Ovaltine!
You're a boom,
You're the dam at Boulder,
You're the moon,
Over Mae West's shoulder,
I'm the nominee of the G. O. P.

Or gop!

But if, baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top!
You're a Waldorf salad.
You're the top!
You're a Berlin ballad.
You're the boats that glide
On the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're an old Dutch master,

You're Lady Astor,
You're broccoli!
You're romance,
You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants, on a Roxy usher,
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,

But if, baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter//c/cole+porter/youre+the+top_20354838.html
