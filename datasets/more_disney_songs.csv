Brave,Into the Open Air,This love it is a distant star Guiding us home wherever we are This love it is a burning sun Shining a light on the things that we've done I tried to speak to you every day But each word we spoke the wind blew away How did we let it come to this? What we've just tasted we somehow still miss How will it feel when this day is done? And can we keep what we've only begun? Could these walls come crumbling down? I want to feel my feet on the ground Can we carry this love that we share? Into the open air Into the open air Into the open air This love it is a burning sun,http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/lyricsbrave2.html

The Rescuers,Tomorrow Is Another Day,"Come along Will there be sunshine shinin'? Will we find a silver linin'? Come along Sing a song When today becomes tomorrow Will we find joy or sorrow? Sing a song Is it wrong To put all our hopes together And wish for somethin' better? Is it wrong? To be loved To face the future with another Who means more than any other Is to be loved We'll paint the grey clouds With pretty rainbow hues And we'll brush the gloom away And save it for a rainy day Rainy day Oh, today If troubles cast a shadow And shadows make the sun afraid to stay But it's okay 'Cause there'll be sunshine shinin' And we'll find a silver linin' Another day Tomorrow is another day How I hope you'll always stay",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/lyricsres.html

Winnie the Pooh,The Tummy Song,"A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy He fills it with things that are sweet A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy By never forgetting to eat When it is growly and grummy The search for the honey is on The Pooh has a knack for finding a snack Unless all the honey is gone A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy No need for the tummy to fret A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy He knows what his tummy must get Don't worry, my round little chummy I'm hearing your ravenous plea When there is no honey The Pooh takes the tummy Wherever the honey will be My friends are out there With honey to spare And they will take care Of my tummy and me",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/lyricswinnie4.html
