Fats Waller,A Lyrics,"
                    A-Tisket A-Tasket
A green and yellow basket
I bought a basket for my mommie
On the way I dropped it
I dropped it, I dropped it
Yes on the way I dropped it
A little girlie picked it up
And took it to the market
She was truckin' on down the 
Avenue without a single thing to do
She was peck, peck, peckin' all around
When she spied it on the ground
A-Tisket A-Tasket
She took my yellow basket 
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I shall die
(Was it red?)
No, no, no, no
(Was it brown?)
No, no, no, no
(Was it blue)
No, no, no, no
Just a little yellow basket                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/f/fats+waller/ + /f/fats+waller/a_21391867.html
Fats Waller,A Little Bit Independent Lyrics,"
                    A little bit independent in your walk
A little bit independent in your talk
There's nothing like you in Paris or New York
You're awfully easy on the eyes
A little bit independent when we dance
A little bit independent toward romance
A bit of sophistication in your glance
And yet you're easy on the eyes
Whenever I'm with you alone
You weave a magic spell
And though it be a danger zone
I only know that you're swell
A little bit independent with your smile
A little bit independent in your style
But how can I help but love you all the while
When you're so easy on the eyes                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/f/fats+waller/ + /f/fats+waller/a+little+bit+independent_20246403.html

Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only

Steam down the river, down to New Orleans

Old friends there to greet us
Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

Basin Street is the street
Where the best folks always meet
In New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems,
Or just how much it really means

Glad to be, oh yes-sirree
Where welcome's free and dear to me
Where I can lose, lose my Basin Street Blues

Old Market Street down by the Frisco Bay,
I've strolled the Prado, I've gambled on the Bourse;
The seven wonders of the world I've seen,
And many are the places I have been,
Take my advice, folks, and see Beale Street first!

You'll see pretty browns in beautiful gowns,
You'll see tailor-mades and hand-me-downs,
You'll meet honest men, and pick-pockets skilled,
You'll find that business never ceases 'til somebody gets killed!

If Beale Street could talk, if Beale Street could talk,

Married men would have to take their beds and walk,
Except one or two who never drink booze,
And the blind man on the corner singing ""Beale Street Blues!""

I'd rather be there than any place I know,
I'd rather be there than any place I know,
It's gonna take a sergeant for to make me go!

I'm goin' to the river, maybe by and by,
Yes, I'm goin' to the river, maybe by and by,
Because the river's wet, and Beale Street's done gone dry!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/f/fats+waller/ + /f/fats+waller/beale+street+blues_21391809.html

Pains in my head, feel like old Ned

Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue

I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?

I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin

A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Fats Waller,I've Got A Crush On You Lyrics,"
                    How glad the many millions of Annabelles and Lillians
Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell

I'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and night time give me sigh
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care?
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush on you

And invite the Vanderbilts to tea?
Everything on which you've got your heart set
Baby, have a little dream on me

Interviews and pictures in the press
What a way to speak on twenty bucks a week
Don't forget that Rockefeller started out on less

Everything we touch will turn to clover
In the magic land of what's to be
But until your baby puts it over
Baby, have a little dream on me

Well, all right then

Everything we touch will turn to clover
In the magic land of what's to be
Till your daddy puts it over, skip it

Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome

Up here in Harlem,
So, everyone start Truckin'.

As soon as the news got 'round,
The folks downtown,
Came up to Harlem,
Saw everbody Truckin'.

It didn't take long
Before the high-hats were doing it,
'Park Avenuing' it,
All over town,
You see them shufflin', shufflin', shufflin' down.

It spread like a forest blaze,
Became a craze,
Thanks to Harlem now,
Everybody's Truckin'.

Holding hands and yawning

In the cozy chair
Picking on a wishbone
From the Frigidaire
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
And too much in love to break away

Do you remember
The nights we used to linger in the hall?
Father didn't like you at all
Do you remember
The reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest
And get a bit of rest

Well, here we are
Just about the same
Foggy little fella
Drowsy little dame

And too much in love to say goodnight                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/f/fats+waller/ + /f/fats+waller/two+sleepy+people_20330769.html

Fats Waller,Your Feet's Too Big Lyrics,"

Mercy! 
Sounds like baby patter 
Baby elephant patter, that's what I calls it] 

Say, up in Harlem, at a table for two, 
There were four of us, me, your big feet and you 
From your ankles up, I say you sure are sweet, 
From there down, there's just too much feet! 

Yes, your feet's too big! 
Don't want ya 'cause your feet's too big! 
Can't use ya 'cause your feet's too big! 
I really hate ya 'cause your feet's too big!

Your girl, she likes ya, she thinks you're nice, 
Got what it takes to be in paradise 
She said she likes your face, she likes your rig, 
But, man, oh, man, them things are too big 

Oh, your feet's too big 
Don't want ya 'cause your feet's too big! 
Mad at ya 'cause your feet's too big 
I hate ya 'cause your feet's too big 

My goodness, gun the gunboats! 
Shift! Shift! Shift!] 

Oh, your pedal extremities are colossal 
To me you look just like a fossil 
You got me walkin', talkin' and squawkin', 
'Cause your feet's too big, yeah 

Come on and walk that thing 
Oh, I never heard o' such walkin', Mercy! 
You know your pedal extremities really are obnoxious.

George Gershwin,'s Wonderful Lyrics,"

Jack has found his Jill;
Don't konw what you've done
But I'm all a-thrill.
How could words express
Your divine appeal?
You can never guess
All the love I feel
From now on, Lady/Darling, I insist,
For me no other girls/guys exist.
's wonderful! 's marvelous!
(That) You should care for me!
's awful nice! 's paradise!
's what I love to see!
You've made my life so glamorous,
You can't blame me for feeling amorous,
's wonderful! 's marvelous!

George Gershwin,(I've Got) Beginner's Luck Lyrics,"
                    At any gambling casino
From Monte Carlo to Reno,
They tell you that a beginner
Comes out a winner.
Beginner fishing for flounder
Will catch a seventeen pounder;
That's what I've always heard
And always thought absurd,
But now I believe every word!

For I've got beginner's luck;
The first time I'm in love
I'm in love with you,
Gosh I'm lucky!

I've got beginner's luck;
There never was such a smile
Or such eyes of blue,
Gosh I'm fortunate!

This thing we've begun
Is much more than a pastime,
For this time is the one
Where the first time is the last time!

I've got beginner's luck,
Lucky through and through,
For the first time that I'm in love,
I'm in love with you!

I've got beginner's luck;
The first time I'm in love
I'm in love with you,
Gosh I'm lucky!

I've got beginner's luck;
They told me beginners win,
Now I know it's true,
Gosh I'm fortunate!

This thing we've begun
Is much more than a pastime,
For this time is the one
Where the first time is the last time!

I've got beginner's luck,
Lucky through and through,
For the first time that I'm in love,
I'm in love with you!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/g/george+gershwin/ + /g/george+gershwin/ive+got+beginners+luck_21365799.html

Out of town were the people I knew

What to do, what to do, what to do?

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London town
It had me low and it had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
The British museum had lost its charm
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?
But the age of miracles hadn't passed
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

George Gershwin,Aren't You Kind Of Glad We Did? Lyrics,"
                    Oh, it really wasn't my intention
To disregard convention
It was just an impulse
That had to be obeyed.

Though it seems convention we've been scorning
I'll still not go in mourning
Though my reputation
Is blemished, I'm afraid.

With just one kiss
What heaven, what rapture, what bliss

Honestly, I thought you wouldn't.
Naturally, you thought you couldn't.
And probably we shouldn't.
But aren't you kind of glad we did?

Actually, it all was blameless.
Nevertheless, they'll call it shameless
So let's keep the lady nameless
But aren't you kind of glad we did?

Socially, I'll be an outcast
Obviously, we dined alone
On my good name there will be doubt cast
With never a sign of any chaperon.

No matter how they may construe it
Whether or not, we have to rue it
Whatever made us do it
Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?

George Gershwin,Begin The Beguine Lyrics,"
                    When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Never tell me dreams come true,
Just try it, and I'll start a riot,
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare,
Ever tell me she will care,
I'm certain, It's the final cutain.

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell me fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love, but not for me,
A lucky star's above, but not for me,
With love to lead the way,
I found more skys of grey,
Than any Russian play could guarantee.

I was a fool to fall, and get that way,
Hi ho! Alas! And also Lack a day!
Although I can't dismiss,
The memory of her kiss,
I guess she's not for me.

It all began so well, but what an end,
This is the time a fella needs a friend,
When every happy plot,
Ends in a marriage knot,
And there's no knot for me.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/g/george+gershwin/ + /g/george+gershwin/but+not+for+me_20162546.html

You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are

Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my anties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.
So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! , how I lost out!

I could cry salty tears;
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt;
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Clombus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendez-vous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

George Gershwin,I'll Build A Stairway To Paradise Lyrics,"
                    Verse One
All you preachers
Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.
It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;
Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practise,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go...
Chorus
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way!
I've got theblues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes! Go on and carry me there!
I'll build a stairway toparadise
With a new step ev'ry day.
Verse Two
Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.
In time you'll getsaint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.

George Gershwin,I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles (interpolated Into The Passing Show Of 1918 Lyrics,"
                    I'm dreaming dreams, I'm scheming schemes
I'm building castles high
They're born anew, their days are few
Just like a sweet butterfly
And as the daylight is dawning
They come again in the morning

I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
Nearly reach the sky
Then like my dreams they fade and die
Fortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air

When shadows creep, when I'm asleep
To lands of hope I stray
Then at daybreak, when I awake
My bluebird flutters away
Happiness, you seem so near me
Happiness, come forth and cheer me

I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
Nearly reach the sky
Then like my dreams they fade and die
Fortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/g/george+gershwin/ + /g/george+gershwin/im+forever+blowing+bubbles+interpolated+into+the+passing+show+of+1918_21362645.html

From millionaires to caddies
Would be to capture me !
But you had such persitence,
You wore down my resistance :
I fell, and it was swell
You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you, I shall never, never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view.
I've got a crush on you, Sweetie pie.
All the day and night-time, hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion
Could you coo?
Could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share?
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you
Could you coo?
Could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share?
Your mush I never shall shush,

Hereand there and yonder,
Wasting precious time
For no reason or rhyme?

Everything is splendid;
Meeting you today
Has given me a wonderful idea 
Here I stay!

It's a funny thing;
I look at you,
I get a thrill I never knew,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

Here we are at last,
It's like a dream,
The two of us, a perfect team,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted,
You with the neighbours,
I at silly labours!
What joys untasted,
You readin Heine,
Me somewhere in China!

Let's forget the past, let's both agree
That I'm for you and you're for me,
And it's such a pity we never, never met before!

Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted,
Fishing for salmon,
Losing at backgammon!
What joys untasted,
My nights were sour,
Spent with Schopenhauer!

George Gershwin,It's De-Lovely Lyrics,"
                    The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si.

Our romance is growing flat,
For you like this and the other
While I go for this and that.
Goodness knows what the end will be;
Oh, I don't know where I'm at...
It looks as if we two will never be one, 
Something must be done.

You say either and I say eyether,
You say neither and I say nyther;
Either, eyether, neither, nyther,
Let's call the whole thing off!

You like potato and I like potatoe,
You like tomato and I like tomatoe; 
Potato, potatoe, tomato, tomatoe!
Let's call the whole thing off!

But oh! If we call the whole thing off,
Then we must part.
And oh! If we ever part,
Then that might break my heart!

So, if you like pyjamas and I like pyjahmas,
I'll wear pyjamas and give up pyjahmas.
For we know we need each other, 
So we better call the calling off off.

Let's call the whole thing off!
You say laughter and I say lawfter,
You say after and I say awfter;
Laughter, lawfter, after, awfter,

Let's call the whole thing off!
You like vanilla and I like vanella,
You, say s'parilla and I say s'parella;
Vanilla, vanella, chocolate, strawberry!

Let's call the whole thing off!
But oh! If we call the whole thing off,
Then we must part.
And oh! If we ever part, 

Then that might break my heart!
So, if you go for oysters and I go for ersters
I'll order oysters and cancel the ersters.

George Gershwin,Life Is Just A Bowl Of Cherries Lyrics,"

Why don't they stop someday, address themselves this way?
Why are we here? Where are we going? It's time that we found out.
We're not here to stay; we're on a short holiday.

Life is just a bowl of cherries.
Don't take it serious; life's so mysterious.
You work, you save, you worry so,
But you can't take your dough when you go, go, go.
So keep repeating it's the berries,
The strongest oak must fall,
The sweet things in life, to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you've never owned?
Life is just a bowl of cherries,
So live and laugh at it all.

Life is just a bowl of cherries.
Don't take it serious; it's too mysterious.
At eight each morning I have got a date,
To take my plunge 'round the Empire State.
You'll admit it's not the berries,
In a building that's so tall;
There's a guy in the show, the girls love to kiss;
Get thousands a week just for crooning like this:

George Gershwin,The Babbitt And The Bromide Lyrics,"
                    A babbitt met a bromide on the avenue one day,
And held a conversation in their own peculiar way;

They both were solid citizens, they both had been around,
And as they spoke you clearly saw their feet were on the ground!

Hello!
How are you?
How's the folks?
What's new?
I'm great!
That's good!
Huh-huh!
Touch wood!
Well well!
what say?
How've you been?
Nice day!
How's things?
What's new?
That's fine!
How are you?


Nice weather we are having, but it gives me such a pain,
I've brought my umbrella so of course it doesn't rain!

Well, hey'ho!
That's life!
What's new?
How's the wife?
Got to run!
Oh my!
Ta-ta!
Olive oil!
Goodbye!

Ten years went quickly by for both these subste-antial men,
And then it happened that one day they chanced to meet again!

That they had both developed in ten years there was no doubt,
And so of course they had an awful lot to talk about!

Hello!
How are you?
How's the folks?
What's new?
I'm great!
That's good!
Huh-huh!
Touch wood!
Well well!
what say?
How've you been?
Nice day!
How's things?
What's new?
That's fine!
How are you?

I seem to know your face but I just can't recall your name!

Well how've you been old boy?  You're looking just about the same!

Well, hey'ho!
That's life!
What's new?
How's the wife?
Got to run!
Oh my!
Ta-ta!
Olive oil!
Goodbye!


Before they met again, some twenty years they had to wait;
This time it happened up above, inside Saint Peter's gate!

A harp each one was carrying, and both were wearing wings,
and this is what they said as they were strumming on the strings;

Hello!
How are you?
How's the folks?
What's new?
Got to run!
Oh my!
Ta-ta!
Olive oil!

George Gershwin,"The Half Of It, Dearie, Blues Lyrics","
                    Each time you trill a song with Bill or look at Will
I get a chill, I'm gloomy
I won't recall the names of all the men who fall
It's all appalling to me
Of course, I really cannot blame them a bit
For you're a hit where're you flit
I know it's so, but dearie, oh!
You'll never know the blues that go right through me
I've got the you-don't-know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues
The trouble is you have so many from whom to choose
If you should marry Tom, Dick, or harry,
Life would be the bunk, I'd become a monk
I've got the you-don't know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues!

To Bill and Ben I'd pay attention now and then
But really men would bore me
When I'd begun to think I'd run and be a nun
I met the one man for me
And now just when the sun is starting to beam
Along comes a girl, zip goes a dream!
What will I do away from you?
I feel the future will be blue and stormy
I've got the you-don't-know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues
It may be my heart isn't broken, but there's a bruise.
Through you I've known some days that were lonesome
Though you say that i'm flirting all the time
I've got the you-don-t know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues!

I've got the you-don't-know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues
Oh, how i wish you'd drop an anchor and end your cruise
You're just a duffer who makes me suffer
All the younger set says your heart's to let

George Gershwin,The Man I Love Lyrics,"
                    When the mellow moon begins to beam,
Ev'ry night I dream a little dream,
And of course Prince Charming is the theme,
The he for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
For/To me it's clear
That he'll appear.
Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong,
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.
He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand ;
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand ;
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not ;
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day
He'll build a little home
Just meant for two,
From which I'll never roam,
Who would - would you ?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/g/george+gershwin/ + /g/george+gershwin/the+man+i+love_20259385.html
George Gershwin,The Moon Is On The Sea Lyrics,"
                    A woman's touch, a woman's touch
The magic of Aladdin couldn't do as much
She's a wizard, she's a champ
And she doesn't need a lamp

A woman's touch can weave a spell
The kind of hocus pocus that she does so well
With the magic of a broom
She can mesmerize a room

With a whisk whisk here and a whisk whisk there
And a dustpan for the cinders
With a rub rub here and a rub rub there
She can polish up the winders

Then presto chango 
Suddenly, the sun comes shining through
And what does Mr Sunshine say to you?
How d'you do?

It makes you blink, to stop and think
A woman and a whisk-broom 
Can accomplish so darn much
So never under-estimate a woman's touch

A woman's touch can quickly fill
The empty flower boxes on a window sill
One smile from her and zoom
Little buds begin to bloom  

A touch of paint, a magic nail
Can turn a kitchen chair into a Chippendale
Even make the lamp appear
Like a crystal chandelier

With a tack tack here and a tack tack there
And a hand around a hammer
With a mop mop here and a mop mop there
You can give a cabin glamour

Then gosh, almighty, all at once
The cabin that we knew
Becomes a shining castle built for two
Me and you

The pies and cakes a woman bakes
Can make a fella tell her 
That he loves her very much
So never under-estimate a woman's touch                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/g/george+gershwin/ + /g/george+gershwin/the+moon+is+on+the+sea_21361463.html
George Gershwin,The Physician Lyrics,"
                    Once I loved such a shattering physician,
Quite the best looking doctor in the state,
He looked after my physical condition
And his bedside manner was great!

When I'd gaze up and see him there above me,
Looking less like a doctor than a Turk,
I was tempted to whisper, ""Do you love me,
Or do you merely love your work?""

He said my bronchial tubes were entrancing,
My epiglottis filled him with glee,
He simply loved my larynx
And went wild about my pharynx,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my epidermis was darling
And found my blood as blue as can be,
He went through wild ecstatics
About my lymphatics,
But he never said he loved me.

And though, no doubt, it was not very smart of me,
I get on a-wracking of my soul,
to figure out why he loved every part of me,
And yet not me as a whole.

By my esophagus he was ravished,
Enthusiastic to a degree,
He said 'twas just enormous,
My appendix vermiformis,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my cerebellum was brilliant,
And my cererum far from N G,
I know he thought a lotta
My medulla oblogota,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my maxillaries were marvels,
And found my sternum stunning to see,
He did a double hurdle
When I shook my pelvic girdle,
But he never said he loved me.

He seemed amused,
When he first made a test of me
To further his medical art;
Yet he refused,
When he's fixed up the rest of me,
To cure that ache in my heart.

I know he thought my pancreas perfect,
And for my spleen was keen as can be,
He said, of all his sweeties,
I'd the sweetest diabetes,
But he never said he loved me.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/g/george+gershwin/ + /g/george+gershwin/the+physician_21362581.html

The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from Missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from histry I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned
They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly
They told marconi
Wireless was a phony
Its the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune
They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
But ho, ho, ho!
Whos got the last laugh now?
They all laughed at Rockefeller center
Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar
Ford and his misery
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are
They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, ""hello, goodbye.""
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie
They all said wed never get together
Darling, lets take a bow
For ho, ho, ho!

Lets at the past laugh

A lot of ushers in tailcoats, reporters and photographers

A ceremony by a bishop who will tie the knot and say
""Do you agree to love and honor?"" Love and honor, yes, but not obey

I wanna wedding ring surrounded by diamonds in platinum
A big reception at the Waldorf with champagne and caviar

I wanna wedding like the Vanderbilts have, ev'rything big, not small
If I can't have that kind of a wedding I don't wanna get married at all

Irving Berlin,"Be Careful, It's My Heart Lyrics","

It's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart
It's not the note that I sent you that you quickly burned
It's not the book I lent you that you'll never return

Remember, it's my heart
The heart with which so willingly I part
It's yours to take, to keep or break
But please, before you start
Be careful, it's my heart                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/be+careful+its+my+heart_20068115.html

Nothing but blue skies

Singing a song

Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly

Nothing but blue skies

Irving Berlin,Can You Use Any Money Today? Lyrics,"

Can you use any money today?
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Nice new bills that we're giving away

There are photographs on ev'ry one
Lincoln, Grant and Washington
Or you might like the ones with Henry Clay
Can you use any money today?

Two million, four million, six million, eight million, ten
Take what you want, when it's gone you can come back again
Bills that haven't been printed yet
You can have them by the sack

Coins that haven't been minted yet
That you never have to give back
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Uncle Sam puts it right on the line

And if we ever run out of checks for him to sign
You can have mine
All of mine
You can have mine

Money, money, money, money, money, money
Can you use any dollars today?
Money, money, money, money, money, money
We've so much that it gets in our way

In our Treas'ry there's a mighty sum
Millions we've subtracted from
The envelopes that hold our take home pay
Can you use any money today?

Home in the states underground there's a cave full of gold
Back up a truck and we'll fill it with all it can hold
Take ten million and please don't fuss
If you find it can't be spent

You can lend it right back to us
And we'll pay you seven percent
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Uncle Sam puts it right on the line

And if that feller with whiskers ever should decline
You can have mine
All of mine
You can have mine                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/can+you+use+any+money+today_21298925.html
Irving Berlin,Change Partners Lyrics,"

You have danced with him since the music began.
Won't you change partners and dance with me?
Must you dance quite so close with your lips touching his face?
Can't you see
I'm longing to be in his place?
Won't you change partners and dance with me?

Ask him to sit this one out.
While you're alone,
I'll tell the waiter to tell
Him he's wanted on the telephone.

You've been locked in his arms ever since heaven-knows-when.
Won't you change partners and then,
You may never want to change partners again.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/change+partners_20068116.html
Irving Berlin,Cheek To Cheek Lyrics,"
                    Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek
Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
(come on and) dance with me
I want my arm(s) about you
That (those) charm(s) about you
Will carry me through...
(right up) to heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (swinging)
Out together dancing cheek to cheek

Irving Berlin,Colonel Buffalo Bill Lyrics,"

Who pleases ev'ry woman, man and child?
Who does his best to give the customers a thrill?
-Who?
Colonel Buff'lo Bill

Who's got the show that gets the most applause?
Five hundred Indians and fifty squaws
Ten feature acts and there's the special feature still
-Who?
Colonel Buff'lo Bill

Did you ever see a cowboy rope a steer?
-No, we haven't
Or an Indian with feathers throw a spear?
-No, we haven't
Or a marksman shoot an earring from an ear?
-No, we haven't
Did you ever see a hold up?
-No, sir
Then gather closer
And let me give you some of the atmosphere

The hour is midnight and all is still
We see the stagecoach climbing up a hill
Going along a mountain trail carrying passengers and mail
Never suspecting danger as they roll along
The watchful driver is in his seat
His trusty rifle lying at his feet
Some of the passengers inside seem to be dozing as they ride
Never suspecting there is something really wrong

Suddenly there's a shout
-What is it all about?
What is it all about you ask? It's Indians
-Indians!
Indians
-Indians!
Very notable, cut your throat-able Indians
-Indians!

Just when they've taken ev'ryone by force
Who makes an entrance on a big white horse?
Who starts a' shootin' till there's no one left to kill
-Gen'ral Grant?
No! Colonel Buff'lo Bill!

-Certainly this is quite a thrill, better than all the vaudeville
-Let us be on the go and see the show with Buff'lo Bill                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/colonel+buffalo+bill_20169429.html
Irving Berlin,Doin' What Comes Natur'lly Lyrics,"
                    Annie oakley and female chorus:
Folks are dumb where I come from,
They ain't had any learning.
Still they're happy as can be
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally).
Folks like us could never fuss
With schools and books and learning.
Still we've gone from A to Z,
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally)
You don't have to know how to read or write
When you're out with a feller in the pale moonlight.
You don't have to look in a book to find out
What he thinks of the moon and what is on his mind.
That comes naturally (that comes naturally).
My uncle out in Texas can't even write his name.
He signs his checks with ""x's""
But they cash them just the same.
If you saw my pa and ma,
You'd know they had no learning,
Still they've raised a family
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally)
Cousin Jack has never read an almanac on drinking
Still he's always on the spree
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally).
Sister Sal who's musical has never had a lesson,
Still she's learned to sing off-key
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally).
You don't have to go a private school
Not to pick up a penny near a stubborn mule,
You don't have to have a professor's dome
Not to go for the honey when the bee's not home.
That comes naturally (that comes naturally).
My tiny baby brother, who's never read a book,
Knows one s** from the other,
All he had to do was look,
Grandpa Bill is on the hill
With someone he just married.
There he is at ninety-three,
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/doin+what+comes+naturlly_20186161.html

That's gonna lift you out of your seat

Upon a syncopated balloon

Hear them tuning up, they'll be playing soon

Of the jazzy fiddle under his chin
Oh, what music
The clarineter could not be better
Hear that strain
I don't know just what it is but it's great
They simply ruin it
Look at 'em doin' it
Come, come don't hesitate
Everybody step if you want to see a glutton
When it comes to struttin' over the ground
Wait'll you see my little sweetie and me
Step, step, stepping around

I'm getting tired of eating in restaurants
They don't appeal to me
If we could own a cute apartment
I'd know just what a joyful heart meant
I hate to think of waiters and bill-of-fares
When evening time draws near
Three little rooms will be just like heaven
When we are married dear
In a

While you're cooking a stew
For me and you

The tuneful Humoresque
And oh, what bliss

You ask me to tea at five
I find you then with other men
And wonder when my chance will arrive

How's chances, say, how are the chances
Of making you love me the way I love you

How many young men must I fight with
To be in right with
In right with you

How's chances for one of those glances
A glimpse of the heaven I'm longing to see

How's chances to end all your romances
And start taking your chances with me

From the dark came a voice, and it seemed to say,
""there you go, there you go.""

How I felt, as I fell, I just can't recall.
But his arms held me fast and it broke the fall.
And I said to my heart as it foolishly
Kepte jumping all around.

I got lost
But look what I found.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/i+got+lost+in+his+arms_20068102.html

Checking up on what I have and what I haven't
What do I find?
A healthy balance on the credit side
Got no diamond
Got no pearl
Still I think I'm a lucky girl
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Got no mansion
Got no yacht

Irving Berlin,I Love A Piano Lyrics,"
                    [1st verse:]
As a child I went wild when a band played
How I ran to the man when his hand swayed
Clarinets were my pets, and a slide trombone I thought was simply
Divine
But today when they play I could hiss them
Ev'ry bar is a jar to my system
But there's one musical instrument that I call mine

[chorus:]
I love a piano, I love a piano
I love to hear somebody play
Upon a piano, a grand piano
It simply carries me away

I know a fine way to treat a steinway
I love to run my fingers o'er the keys, the ivories

And with the pedal I love to meddle
When padarewski comes this way
I'm so delighted if I'm invited
To hear that long haired genius play

So you can keep your fiddle and your bow
Give me a p-i-a-n-o, oh, oh
I love to stop right beside an upright
Or a high toned baby grand

[2nd verse:]
When a green tetrazine starts to warble
I grow cold as an old piece of marble
I allude to the crude little party singer who don't know when to pause
At her best I detest the soprano
But I run to the one at the piano
I always love the accomp'niment and that's because                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/i+love+a+piano_20068103.html

And nothing to say,
But simply go on my way
And call it a day.

I guess I'm ready to go
Right back on the shelf,
Because at last I've learned
Where you're concerned,
I've just been fooling myself.

I never had a chance,
I thought you cared for me,
But now I see I never had a chance.
I never had a chance.
Though you never told me so,
Somehow I know I never had a chance.

I knew we'd have to part,
For I could always reach your lips
But I could never reach your heart.
My dream about romance
Ended in a friendly chat.
But more than that,
I never had a chance.

I thought you cared for me,
But now I see I never had a chance.

How a dreary world can suddenly change
To a world as bright as the evening star
Queer

And you see things as they really are

I used to be color-blind
But I met you and now I find
There's green in the grass
There's gold in the moon
There's blue in the skies

That semi-circle that was always hanging about
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow
And you brought the colors out

Believe me it's really true
Till I met you I never knew
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies

I never knew there were such lovely colors
And the big surprise
Is the red in your cheeks
The gold in your hair
The blue in your eyes                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/i+used+to+be+color+blind_20068121.html

Haven't got much, even that much to my name
Fortune's door shut, can't get in, but just the same

My sense of humor, my disposition, my rosy future
I'll share it all with you

You know what that brings
Furs and diamond rings
And besides those things
There'll be

My ear for music, my feet for dancing, my lips for kissing
I'll share it all with you

My head for thinking, my face for smiling, my hands for cooking
I'll share it all with you

Underneath my hat

I'm honored, I'm flattered, this greeting really mattered
This welcome is grand but I'm really concerned
I like your attention, but this I have to mention
You're playing with fire and you're apt to get burned
There's a girl in Tennessee
Who's sorry she met up with me
Can't go back to Tennessee
I'm a bad, bad man
There's a girl in Omaha
But I ran faster than her pa
Can't go back to Omaha
I'm a bad, bad man
There's a girl in Wyoming and they're combing Wyoming
To find the man in white who was out with her that night
There's a girl in Arkansas
The sheriff is her brother-in-law
Can't go back to Arkansas
I'm a bad, bad man
[Girls:]
You're making too much fuss
For we don't give a tinker's cuss
We've been out, yes, each of us
With a bad, bad man
We've been chasing up and down
That other show has just left town
And the one who played the clown
Was a bad, bad man
You may love us and leave us, but the parting won't grieve us
We'll turn the other cheek when the minstrels come next week
When the show folks come to call
A girl may slip but she won't fall
We'll give some but won't give all
To a bad, bad man
[Frank:]
For years I have yearned to play towns I could return to
And ""this may be it"" from the way that you speak
I'm glad you're not frightened, the atmosphere has brightened
And now let's make plans for a wonderful week
Monday when my show is done
I'll teach you how to shoot a gun
You may find it lots of fun
With a bad, bad man
Tuesday there's no matinee
But I'll be in my tent all day
You can come around and play
With a bad, bad man
Send your mothers on Wednesday because Wednesday's old hens' day
But Thursday is sublime, I'll have lots of open time
Friday night will be the test
If Saturday you're still my guest
Sunday you can come and rest

Falling over land and sea

You can make the cares and troubles
That followed me through the day
Fold their tents just like the Arabs
And silently steal away

Evening, lady of the evening
I hear you calling me

After the sun when its day's work is done comes the evening
Then with the night comes the angels who light up the evening
There in the sky they stand, each with a torch in hand
Then one by one, little stars in the sky

Tangled wildwood
Counting sheep

With a great big valise full
Of books to read where it's peaceful
While I'm
Killing time
Being lazy

Life is short
And getting shorter with each day that goes by
And how the time does fly
Before you know, it's over

Irving Berlin,My Defenses Are Down Lyrics,"
                    Frank butler:
I've had my way with so many girls
An' was lots of fun.
My scheme was to know many girls
To keep me safe from one
I find it can be done.
My defenses are down
She's broken my resistance
And I don't know where I am
I went into the fight like a lion
But I came out like a lamb.
My defenses are down
She's got me where she wants me
And I can't escape no how
I could speak to my heart when it wakened
But my heart won't listen now.
Like a toothless, clawless tiger,
Like an organ-grinder's bear,
Like a knight without his armor,
Like Samson without his hair.
My defenses are down
I might as well surrender
For the battle can't be won.
But I must confess that I like it,
So there's nothing to be done.
Yes, I must confess that I like it
Being miserable's gonna be fun

His defenses are down
She's broken my resistance
And he's in an awful jam.

Irving Berlin,No Strings Lyrics,"
                    I wake up every morning with a smile on my face
Everything in it's place as it should be
I start out every morning just as free as the breeze
My cares upon the shelf
Because I find myself with

No strings and no connections
No ties to my affections
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy

No dates that can't be broken
No words that can't be spoken
Especially when I am feeling romancy

Like a robin upon a tree
Like a sailor that goes to sea
Like an unwritten melody
I'm free, that's me

So

Bring on the big attraction
My decks are cleared for action
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/no+strings_10145454.html
Irving Berlin,Now It Can Be Told Lyrics,"

History placed them in a romantic set
In between book covers they are side by side
But the real thing hasn't been written yet

Now it can be told
Told in all it's glory
Now that we have met
The world may know the sentimental story

The greatest romance they ever knew
Is waiting to
Unfold

Now it can be told
As an inspiration
Every other tale
Of boy meets girl is just an imitation

The great love story
Has never been told before
But now
Now it can be told                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/now+it+can+be+told_20068107.html
Irving Berlin,Oh How That German Could Love! Lyrics,"
                    [1st verse:]
Once I got stuck on a sweet little German
And oh what a German was she
The best that was walking, well what's the use talking
Was just made to order for me
So lovely, and witty, more yet she was pretty
You don't know until you have tried
She had such a figure, it couldn't be bigger
And there was some more yet beside

[chorus:]
Oh how that German could love
With a feeling that came from the heart
She called me her honey, her angel, her money
She pushed ev'ry word out so smart
She spoke like a speaker, and oh what a speech
Like no other speaker could speak
Ach my what a German when she kissed her Herman
It stayed on my cheek for a week

[2nd verse:]
This girl could squeeze, and it never would hurt
For that lady knew just how to squeeze
Her loving was killing, more yet she was willing
You never would have to say please
I just couldn't stop her, for dinner and supper
Some kisses and hugs was the food
When she wasn't nice it was more better twice
When she's bad she was better than good

[2nd chorus]
Oh how that German could love
With a sweetness that's sweeter than sweet
Just say what you please, you would hug and you'd squeeze
Just the shoes that she wore on her feet
Her smile was like money that somebody owed you
That somebody wanted to give
When you felt like dying and she started sighing
Ach my it was worthwhile to live

[3rd verse:]
Sometimes we'd love for a week at a time
And it only would seem like a day
How well I remember, one night in December
I felt like the middle of May
I'll bet all I'm worth that when she came on earth
All the angels went out on parade
No other one turned up, I think that they burned up
The pattern from which she was made

[3rd chorus:]
Oh how that German could love
With a love like you see in a play
When she said, ""My dear,"" it would ring in my ear
For a year, and a week and a day
Her no was like yes, and her yes was like no
It was something like yes, it was, well
When we got together ach donner und vetter
'Twas love with a capital ""L""                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/oh+how+that+german+could+love_20213002.html

They all love me

Oh! How I hate to get up in the morning
Oh! How I'd love to remain in bed

Ya gotta get up
Ya gotta get up
Ya gotta get up this morning

Someday I'm going to murder the bugler
Someday they're going to find him dead

I'll amputate his reveille
And step upon it heavily
And spend the rest of my life in bed

That peanut on your shoulders that you think with

The polish on your finger tips
I hate your eyes of heavenly blue

Outside of that, I love you

I hate the flashy clothes you wear
I hate the patent shine on your shoe
I hate the closet that you keep your clothes in
I hate the handkerchief you blow your nose in

Irving Berlin,Overture Lyrics,"
                    [On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/overture_21301103.html
Irving Berlin,Pack Up Your Sins And Go To The Devil Lyrics,"
                    Oh, I got a message from below
'Twas from a man I used to know
About a year or so ago, before he departed
He is just as happy as can be

I'll tell you what he said to me
He said, ""If ever you get heavy-hearted
Pack up your sins and go to the devil in Hades
You'll meet the finest of gentlemen and the finest of ladies
They'd rather be down below than up above

Hades is full of thousands of Joneses and Browns
O'Hoolihans, Cohens, and Bradys
You'll hear a heavenly tune that went to the devil
Because the jazz bands they started pickin' it
Then put a trick in it, a jazzy kick in it

They've got a couple of old reformers in heaven
Making them go to bed at eleven
Pack up your sins and go to the Devil
And you'll never have to go to bed at all

If you care to dwell where the weather is hot
H-E-double-L is a wonderful spot
If you need a rest and you're all out of sorts
Hades is the best of the winter resorts

Paradise doesn't compare: all the nice people are there
They come there from everywhere
Just to revel with Mister Devil
Nothing on his mind but a couple of horns

Satan is waitin' with his jazz band
And his band came from Alabam' with a melody hot
No one gives a damn if it's music or not
Satan's melody makes you want to dance forever
And you never have to go to bed at all                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/pack+up+your+sins+and+go+to+the+devil_21300179.html

Upon Lennox Avenue
On that famous thoroughfare
With their noses in the air

High hats and narrow collars
White spats and fifteen dollars
Spending every dime
For a wonderful time

If you're blue
And you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where Harlem sits
Puttin' on the Ritz
Spangled Gowns upon the bevy of
High browns from down the levy
All misfits
Puttin' on the Ritz

That's where each and every lulu-belle goes
Every Thursday evening with her swell beaus
Rubbin' elbows

Come with me and we'll attend their jubilee
And see them spend
Their last two bits
Puttin' on the Ritz

High browns from down the levy

Puttin' on that certain Ritz

Every Thursday evening with her swell beaus
Rubbin' elbows

And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

Irving Berlin,The Hostess With The Mostes' On The Ball Lyrics,"
                    I was born on a thousand acres of Oklahoma land
Nothing grew on the thousand acres for it was gravel and sand
One day father started digging in a field
Hoping to find some soil
He dug and he dug and what do you think?
Oil, oil, oil
The money rolled in and I rolled out with a fortune piled so high
Washington was my destination
And now who am I?
I'm the chosen party giver
For the White House clientele
And they know that I deliver
What it takes to make 'em jell
And in Washington I'm known by one and all
As the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
They could go to Elsa Maxwell
When they had an axe to grind
They could always grind their axe well
At the parties she designed
Now the hatchet grinders all prefer to call
On the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
I've a great big bar and good caviar
Yes, the best that can be found
And a large amount in my bank account
When election time comes 'round
If you're feeling presidential
You can make it, yes, indeed
There are just three things essential
Let me tell you all you need
Is an ounce of wisdom and a pound of gall
And the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
An Ambassador has just reached the shore
He's a man of many loves
An important gent from the Orient
To be handled with kid gloves
He can come and let his hair down
Have the best time of his life
Even bring his new affair down
Introduce her as his wife
But she mustn't leave her panties in the hall
For the hostess who's the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
[Encore:]
I've been highly complimented
And I thank you what is more
You'll be damned well represented
By your new ambassador
For my one ambition is to make them fall
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
In the handbag that I'll carry
There's a precious little note
To their highnesses from Harry
Introducing me he wrote:
""I'll appreciate a favor large or small
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball""
There'll be no mistakes, I've got what it takes
To make friends across the sea
I'll make being smart an important part
Of my foreign policy
I'll cement our good relations
When I give my first affair
There'll be special invitations
To the Duke and Duchess there
Who's already written asking them to call
Not the priestess with the leastes'
But the hostess who's the hostess with the mostes' on the ball                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/the+hostess+with+the+mostes+on+the+ball_20221408.html

Come from houses with marble stairs
A little place for you and for me

Just a little room or two can more than do a little man and wife
That's if they're contented with the little things in life
Living on a larger scale would soon entail a lot of care and strife
We could be so happy with the little things in life

A little rain, a little sun, a little work, a little fun
A little time for loving when the day is done
And a little thing that cries for lullabies could make a man and wife
Tell the world how much they love the little things in life                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/the+little+things+in+life_21299157.html
Irving Berlin,The Piccolino Lyrics,"
                    By the Adriatic waters
Venetian sons and daughters
Are strumming a new tune upon their guitars
It was written by a Latin

A gondolier who sat in
His home out in Brooklyn and gazed at the stars
He sent his melody
Across the sea

To Italy
And we know
They wrote some words to fit
That catchy bit

And christened it
The Piccolino
And we know that it's the reason
Why everyone this season

Is strumming and humming a new melody
Come to the casino
And hear them play the Piccolino
Dance with your bambino

To the strains of the catchy Piccolino
Drink your glass of vino
And when you've had your plate of scalopino
Make them play the Piccolino

The catchy Piccolino
And dance to the strains of that new melody

Irving Berlin,The Song Is Ended Lyrics,"
                    My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/the+song+is+ended_10145464.html
Irving Berlin,There's No Business Like Show Business Lyrics,"
                    There's no business like show business like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show

The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men because
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause.
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?

There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back?  Let's go on with the show

(there's no business like show business like no business I know)
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on

(there's no people like show people, they smile when they are low)
Yesterday they told you you would not go far, that night you open and there you are
Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the show!!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/theres+no+business+like+show+business_20068144.html
Irving Berlin,They Say It's Wonderful Lyrics,"

It's wonderful, so they say

And, with a moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand
And

The thing that's known as romance is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And, without any warning
You're stopping people, shouting that love is grand
And

To hold a girl in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way

A bunch of frightened rookies were list'ning filled with awe
They listened while a sergeant was laying down the law
They stood there at attention, their faces turning red
The sergeant looked them over and this is what he said
This is the Army, Mister Jones!
No private rooms or telephones
You had your breakfast in bed before
But you won't have it there any more
This is the Army, Mister Green!
We like the barracks nice and clean
You had a housemaid to clean your floor
But she won't help you out any more
Do what the buglers command
They're in the Army and not in a band
This is the Army, Mister Brown!
You and your baby went to town
She had you worried but this is war
And she won't worry you anymore                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/this+is+the+army+mister+jones_20316227.html

A top hat, a white tie and tails""

Because I'm invited to step out this evening

Brushin' off my tails

I'm dudein' up my shirt front
Puttin' in the shirt studs
Polishin' my nails

To breathe an atmosphere that simply reeks with class
And I trust that you'll excuse my dust when I step on the gas

Love is as sweet as a nut
Love is grander than tongue can tell
Love is remarkable, but
Look at what it did to Antony
It made a fool out of Antony
If love could do that to Antony
What chance have I with love?
Look at what it did to Romeo
It dealt poor Romey an awful blow
If love could do that to Romeo
What chance have I with love?
Look at what it did to Samson
'Til he lost his hair he was brave
If a haircut could weaken Samson
They could murder me with a shave
Look at what it did to Bonaparte
He lost his head when he lost his heart
If he kicked over the apple cart
What chance have I
An ordinary guy
What chance have I with love                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/what+chance+have+i+with+love_20340428.html

                    There's a change in fashion that shows
In those Lenox Avenue clothes
Mister Dude has disappeared with his flashy tie
You'll see in the Harlem Esquire
What the well-dressed man will desire
When he's struttin' down the street with his sweetie-pie

Sun tan, shade of green
Or an olive drab color scheme
That's what the well-dressed man in Harlem will wear

Dressed up in O.D.'s
With a tin hat for overseas
That's what the well-dressed man in Harlem will wear

Top hat, white tie and tails no more
They've been put away till after the war

Take a look at Brown Bomber Joe

You can have him
I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
I'm giving him the sack
And he can go right back where he came from
I could never make him happy
He'd be better off with you
I'm afraid I never loved him
All I ever wanted to do was

Run my fingers thru his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near
Give him babies one for ev'ry year, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him
For he's not the man for me

[monique:]
You can have him
I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
He isn't my concern
And he can just return where he came from
I would look a trifle silly
Taking him away from you
That was never my intention
All I ever wanted to do was

Close the window while he soundly slept
Raid the icebox where the food is kept
Cook a breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray
After breakfast clear the things away
Bring the papers and when they've been read
Spend the balance of the day in bed, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him
For he's not the man for me                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/you+can+have+him_20068151.html

Until you do
I won't take it on the chin
You'll never leave me flat
I'm not a ""last year's hat""
That you can cast aside
I've got my pride
And I won't stand for that

But you can't brush me off

But you can't brush me off
You can't lock me out

But you can't brush me off
You can drop a hint but I won't take it
You can tell me bad news

To go
No

Irving Berlin,You Can't Get A Man With A Gun Lyrics,"
                    Oh, my mother was frightened by a shotgun, they say
That's why I'm such a wonderful shot.
I'd be out in the cactus and I'd practice all day,
And now tell me what have I got?
I'm quick on the trigger with targets not much bigger than a pinpoint
I'm number one, but my score with a feller
Is lower than a celler, oh you can't get a man with a gun.
When I'm with a pistol, I sparkle like a crystal
Yes, I shine like the morning sun,
But I lose all my luster, when with a bronco buster,
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun
If I went to battle with someone's herd of cattle
You'd have steak when the job was done.
But, if I shot the herder, they'd holler bloody murder
And you can't shoot a male in the tail like a quail,
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
I'm cool, brave, and daring to see a lion glaring
When I'm out with my Remington.
But a look from a mister will raise a fever blister
Oh you can't get a man with a gun
The gals with umbrellas are always out with fellers
In the rain or the blazin sun
But a man never trifles with gals who carry rifles
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun.
A man's love is mighty, he'll even buy a nightie
For a gal who he thinks is fun.
But they don't buy pajamas for pistol packin mamas
And you can't get a hug from a mug, with a slug
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/you+cant+get+a+man+with+a+gun_20351548.html

Just when I've learned to forget
I close my eyes, dear, and there you are

You keep coming back like a song
A song that keeps saying, remember

The sweet used-to-be
That was once you and me

Returns to my room in december

Nobody understood why

All the other girls passed him by
Everyone wanted to know
How she could pick such a beau
With a twinkle in her eye
She made this reply
[1st chorus:]
He's not so good in a crowd but when you get him alone
You'd be surprised
He isn't much at a dance but then when he takes you home
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look like much of a lover
But don't judge a book by it's cover
He's got the face of an Angel
But there's a Devil in his eye
He's such a delicate thing but when he starts in to squeeze
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look very strong but when you sit on his knee
You'd be surprised
At a party or at a ball
I've got to admit that he's nothing at all
But in a morris chair
You'd be surprised

Johnny's remarkable ways
To the ladies
And you know advertising pays
Now Johnny's never alone

But you don't know the half of it, dearie

But there's fire in his eyes
He doesn't say very much but when he starts in to speak
You'd be surprised
He's not so good at the start but at the end of the week
You'd be surprised
On a streetcar or in a train
You'd think he was born without any brain
But in a taxicab

With big blue eyes and tiny feet
Her name is Rosabelle Malone
And she tips the scale at twenty stone.

Oh, gee, but ain't it grand to have a girl so big and fat
That when you go to hug her, you don't know where you're at
You have to take a piece of chalk in your hand
And hug a ways and chalk a mark to see where you began

One day I was a-huggin' and a-chalkin' and a-chalkin' and a-huggin' away
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' around the other way over the mountain
Comin' around the other way

Oh Gee, it ain't so grand to be a girl so big and fat
That when you go to hug me you don't know where you're at

I have to take a piece of chalk in my hand
And hug away and chalk a mark to see where I began

Now where is that chalk? Ah, here it is
I'll put one cross here, and another one here.

Darling.

Ah, but seriously you know that I'm crazy about you, 
and I mean all of you, every little bit.

We both feel we're meant for each other.

Yet when we walk through the street people think 
that I'm out with my mother.

One day I was a-huggin' and a-chalkin' and a-beggin' her to be my bride
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' around the other side, It was Lou Praeger
Comin' around the other side.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/johnny+mercer/ + /j/johnny+mercer/a+huggin+and+a+chalkin_21193427.html

While I start reviewin'
The attitude of doin' right

You've got to accentuate the positive
Eliminate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mister In-Between

You've got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
Have faith or pandemonium's
Liable to walk upon the scene

To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark
What did they do just when everything looked so dark?

(Man, they said ""We'd better accentuate the positive"")
(""Eliminate the negative"")
(""And latch on to the affirmative"")
Don't mess with Mister In-Between (No!)
Don't mess with Mister In-Between

(Ya got to spread joy up to the maximum)

You got to ac (yes, yes) -cent-tchu-ate the positive
Eliminate (yes, yes) the negative
And latch (yes, yes) on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mister In-Between
No, don't mess with Mister In-Between                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/johnny+mercer/ + /j/johnny+mercer/ac+cent+tchu+ate+the+positive_20164720.html
Johnny Mercer,Ace In The Hole Lyrics,"
                    This town is full of guys
Who think they’re mighty wise
Just because they know a thing or two

You’ll meet them, night and day
Strollin’ up and down Broadway
Telling of the wonders they can do

Oh, sing it, Bobby boy!
I just did

There’s con men and there’s boosters
There’s card sharks and crapshooters
They congregate around the Metropole

If I knew what that meant, I would agree with him
They wear flashy ties and collars
Yes, but where do they get their dollars?
They all have got an ace, down in the hole

Yes, and some of them write
To the old folks for coin
And that is their ace in the hole

And others have friends
On the old Tenderloin
That’s their old ace in the hole

Why, they’ll tell you of trips
That they’re going to make
From Florida to the North Pole

The fact is, their name would be 'Mud'
Just like a chum playin’ stud
If they lost that old ace in the hole

Oh yes, now, some of them write
You’ll find a lot of them write to the
  (Just a minute, just a minute)

Let the man play his piano solo
But I want to sing tenor
I don’t really care if you sing ten or twenty minutes
After he’s through playin’ piano

Listen to ‘em, I think I make it better than he does
Well, that’s the nastiest remark I’ve ever heard
Listen now, if you don’t like the way I sing
Why don’t you sing?
Sing 'Melancholy Baby', sing something!

Why, they tell you of the trips
They’re gonna make
Over Florida, all the way up to the North Pole
Oh, it’s sad, it's sad, Volare!

But their names would be mud
Like a chum playin’ stud
If they lost that old ace, ace in the hole

Have another drink!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/johnny+mercer/ + /j/johnny+mercer/ace+in+the+hole_20824393.html

And give you the big eye but when that sweet talk is done
A woman's a two faced, a woman's something

Doo wee, heaven blows the lonesome whistle
Blowing across the thresh hold, doo wee, doo wee ta too tee
A crickety crack go wickety wack the blues in the night

Evening breeze will start
Trees that crying in the
All in the world wood haunted slide
When you get the blues in the night

So take my word or the mocking bird
Will sing a sadder kind of song
Maybe he knows things
He knows things can go wrong

A match is a maybe love is the same job
Whenever the four winds blow, I've been to some big town
Had me some big town but there is one thing I know
A woman's a two faced a woman's something

Johnny Mercer,Bob White Lyrics,"
                    Just listen to the Bob White
He never could sing right
You should hip it to the latest sound
And the talk that's goin' 'round

Well, I was talking to the parakeet
And he said, ""Man, now about that beat""
(How about that beat?)
""Hey Bob White, ain't you gonna swing tonight?""

Several people heard the Albatross
(Yes)
Whisper Robin is on the sauce
(I know for a fact he's on the wagon)
Bob White, nothing but a neophyte
(John, what does that word mean?)
(Amateur)

Even the Pheasant found it unpleasant
Hearing you hit that flat note
Whereas the Sparrow froze to his marrow
When he heard that note

The opinion of the Tufted Grouse
Is you play to an empty house
(Could happen to anybody, sure could)
Get up, off that pair
Shape up, make it dare
Bob White, you gotta sing it out tonight

Take a letter to the Meadowlark
In reply to his rude remark
(Well, the mails must go through)
Bob White, invites you to a bash tonight
(My tux isn't even pressed)

Take a wire to the Nightingale
Tell him Bob ain't begun to wail
Bob White's gonna put him down for spite
(Circulate the word)

Call up the Catbird
Tell that old fat bird
He's gonna sing a storm up
Hip the Canary, it'll be scary
After the warm up

Man, he's even gonna gas the goose
He'll be a' looser than Dr. Seuss
(Wait a minute John, do I detect a note
Of meaning that he's gonna be 'right in tune?)
Man, I'm telling you, he's gonna be 'on the moon
(I see)

Bob White
He's gonna ball it up tonight
Oh, he's in there
Guy whistles pretty
Yeah, like a bird, what?

Here's a wire from the Albatross
(Sounds urgent)
It reads, 'Robin is still the boss'
(Well, thank you very much folks)
Bob White, he was in the groove tonight
(Ha ha ha)

I quote directly from the Whoopin' Crane
He says, ""Man, it was like insane""
(He made it plain)
Bob White really fought a groovy fight
I thought I had him dead in the third round

Hey, old poppa Red Bird
Who is the head bird
Says you were in there swingin'
(He was tryin')
Even the Jackdaw
Flew out the back door
Buckin' and wingin'

You instigated such a swingin' gig
That all them quadrapeds wanna dig
(Here, here, you mean)
Here come, the moose and elk
And there goes Lawrence Welk

You really sang it out tonight

A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""

Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""

Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

And never gone nowhere

Her words were sweet like wine 
She bought him diamonds and limousines 
She stole that man o' mine 

When night comes a-creepin' 
For me there's no sleeping 
What she sews, she'll be reapin' 
'Cause she done me wrong

I cried my heart out in Salt Lake City 
The day I heard the news

Johnny Mercer,I May Be Wrong Lyrics,"

Deuces to me are all aces
Life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces
You might be John Barrymore
You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

Life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces
You might be John Barrymore
You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

You said that Edison would never make that light
You laughed at Mr. Franklin with his key and kite

That out of sight is out of mind
Maybe that's so but I tried to go
And leave you behind, what did I find

I took a trip on the train
And I thought about you,
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you,

Two or three cars parked under the stars
A winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, same old dream

At every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
But when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue,

I peeked through the crack
And looked at the track
The one going back to you
And what did I do

Who'll leave you to learn
That mis'ry loves company, wait and see

I mean, I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine

As I sit there applaudin' from a front-row seat

I admit I was never one adored by local lads
Not that I ever tried to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint

I'm old fashioned, I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This years fancies are passing fancies
But sighing sighs, holding hands
These my heart understands

I'm old fashioned but I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me.

Over land and sea,
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me;

Again I long to be;

Johnny Mercer,Jamboree Jones Lyrics,"
                    I'll begin the story
Out in West Virginia
Is a little college
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

All the student body
Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it

Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch `em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

`Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)
And then the students all began to yell

The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.
Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still

Just as it always will
And there's a picture in the hall of fame
You'll find the boy in the frame who won the game
Jamboree Jones was the gentleman's name.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/johnny+mercer/ + /j/johnny+mercer/jamboree+jones_21193905.html

When he was mummy's boy

I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side

The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot
What?

Bells, bells all the way
I don't know whose playing 'em bells
But I wish they'ed sound that way

Hey, bells, bells all the way
Oh listen to the very merry melody we play

And his business is writing songs
It's a kind of a gift and I get a big lift
From his melodies and diphthongs

We got to talk him once
I was curious as could be
To explain what to do, let him tell it to you
Just the way it was told to me

First you write a little ol' tune, real easy
Not as hard to play as let's say part cheesy
Real simple chords in the key of C
A melody you can groove

Next you add some little ol' words on to it
Try to get some people who'll sing to do it
Then if they say, “My have you got a hit”
You act non committal and say, “Just a little ol' tune”

Now record your little ol' tune, just hum it
Could you try to fancy it up? Far from it
Dub in some top tenor harmony
Just me, me, me, as you groove

Yes, next you sing a baritone part from way back
Add a zoom, zoom, bass and then start the playback
And when they say, “Ma, he's singing forte”
You act non committal and say, “Just a little ol' tune”
You act non committal and say, “Just a little, just a little ol' tune”                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/johnny+mercer/ + /j/johnny+mercer/little+ol+tune_20826560.html

I figure that it's engine number forty-nine
She's the only one that'll sound that way
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe

See the old smoke risin' 'round the bend
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend
Folks around these parts get the time of day
From the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe

Here she comes, woo oo woo oo woo oo woo oo woo woo
Hey Jim, you better get out the rig
Woo oo woo oo woo oo woo oo woo woo
She's got a list of passengers that's pretty big

And they'll all want lifts to Brown's Hotel
'Cause lots of them been travelin' for quite a spell
All the way from Philadelphia

Johnny Mercer,One For My Baby (And One More For The Road) Lyrics,"
                    It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place except you and me
So set 'em up Joe, I've got a little story you oughta know
We're drinking my friend to the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road

I got the routine, so drop another nickel in the machine
I'm feeling so bad, I wish you'd make the music dreamy and sad
Could tell you a lot but that's not in a gentleman's code
Just make it one for my baby and one more for the road

You'd never know it but buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things to say
And when I'm gloomy, you simply got to listen to me
Until it's talked away

Well that's how it goes and Joe I know you're gettin' anxious to close
So thanks for the beer, I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear
Don't let it be said that little Freddie can't carry his load
Just make it one for my baby and one more for the road

Johnny Mercer,Out Of This World Lyrics,"
                    You're clear out of this world
When I'm looking at you,
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew.

You're right out of a book,
The fairy tale I read when I was so high;
No armoured knight out of a book
Could find a more enchanted Lorelei than I.

After waiting so long for the right time,
After reaching so long for a star,
All at once from the long and lonely night time,
And despite time, here you are!

I'd fly out of this world
If you said we were through,
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two with you;
I'll spend the next eternity or two with you.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/johnny+mercer/ + /j/johnny+mercer/out+of+this+world_21193683.html
Johnny Mercer,Personality Lyrics,"
                    Personality
Johnny Mercer
Words by Johnny Burke
Music by Jimmy Van Heusen

Peaked at # 1 in 1946
Competing versions charted by Bing Crosby (#9) and Dinah Shore (#10)
Sung by Dorothy Lamour in ""The Road To Utopia"" also starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby

When Madam Pompadour was on a ballroom floor
Said all the gentlemen ""Obviously,""
""The madam has the cutest personality""

And think of all the books about Du Barry's looks
What was it made her the toast of Paree?
She had a well-developed personality

(What did Romeo see in Juliet?)
(Or Figaro in Figarette?)
(Or Jupiter in Juno?)
You know!

And when Salome danced and had the boys entranced
No doubt it must have been easy to see
That she knew how to use her personality

(A girl can learn to spell and take dictation well)
(And never sit on the boss's left knee)
(Unless she's got a perfect personality)

(A girl can get somewhere in spite of stringy hair)
(Or even just a bit bowed at the knee)
(If she can show a faultless personality)

Why are certain girls offered certain things
Like sable coats and wedding rings?
By men who wear their spats right?
(That's right!)

(So don'tcha say ""I'm smart and have the kindest heart""
(Or ""what a wonderful sister I'd be"")

Just tell me how you like my
Mercer ""Rufff!!

You'll start in dog-walkin' no matter where.
There's jazz-copation blues modulation,
Just like a Haitian you'll rip and tear.
Most everybody likes the blues

Here's why I'm ravin', here's why I'm ravin'
If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.
You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""
Because your feet they can't refuse.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane;
Can't keep still, Tho it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree;
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody Grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan?, Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, But Royal Garden Blues.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/johnny+mercer/ + /j/johnny+mercer/royal+garden+blues_21194225.html

When an irresistible force such as you
Meets an old immovable object like me
You can bet as sure as you live
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give,
Something's gotta give.
When an irrepressible smile such as yours
Warms an old implacable heart such as mine
Don't say no because I insist.
Somewhere, somehow,
Someone's gonna be kissed.
So en garde who knows what the fates have in store
from their vast mysterious sky?
I'll try hard ignoring those lips I adore
but how long can anyone try?
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might,
Chances are some heavenly star spangled night
We'll find out as sure as we live
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give,
Something's gotta give.

Johnny Mercer,Strip Polka Lyrics,"
                    This is the strip polka
I adore this [incomprehensible]

[incomprehensible]

There's a burlesque theater where the gang loves to go
To see queenie the cutie of the burlesque show
And the thrill of the evening is when out queenie skips
And the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off, take it off"", cries a voice from the rear
""Take it off, take it off"", soon it's all you can hear
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops and always just in time

She's as fresh and as wholesome as the flowers in May
And she hopes to retire to the farm someday
But you can't buy a farm until you're up in the chips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off, take it off"", all the customers shout
""Down in front, down in front"", while the band beats it out
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops and always just in time

Queenie, queen of them all
Queenie, someday you'll fall
Someday church bells will chime
In strip polka time

Oh, she hates corny waltzes and she hates the gavotte
And there's one big advantage if the music's hot
It's a fast moving exit just in case something rips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

Drop around, take it in, it's the best in the west
""Take it off, take it off, take it off"", you can yell like the rest
Take her out when it's over, she's a peach when she's dressed
But she stops and always just in time, time, time

Queenie, queen of them all
Queenie, someday you'll fall
Someday church bells will chime
In strip polka time                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/johnny+mercer/ + /j/johnny+mercer/strip+polka_20812765.html

It lingered there to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long, we sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flying by
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind and the winter winds, they have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies, through nights that never end
My fick-le friend, the summer wind

There's a new gal in town.
Gals are jealous, there's no doubt.

Sweet, Sweet Georgia Brown.
And ever since she came, the common folks all claim, say;

No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).
It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town.
Since she came why it's a shame how she's cooled 'em down.
Fellas that she can't get must be fellas that she ain't met.
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her, Sweet Georgia Brown. 

All you gals will get the blues, 
all you pals will surely lose.
And, there's but one excuse.
Now I've told you who she was, 
and I've told you what she does,
Still, give this gal her dues.
This pretty maiden's prayer is answered anywhere 

No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).
All those tips the porter slips to Sweet Georgia Brown
They buy clothes at fashion shows for one dollar down.

On a little side street in old Bombay
And met a sentimental oriental
She saw me and I saw she
Had a manner too bold and much too free
Her eyes were positively detrimental
When I asked about this gay coquette
I discovered much to my regret

She's the girl friend of the whirling dervish
She's the sweetest one he's found
But ev'ry night, in the mellow moonlight
When he's out dervishing with all his might
She gives him the run-around

All the boy friends of the whirling dervish
Are his best friends to his face
But there's no doubt, when he isn't about
They all come hurrying to take her out
She leads him a dizzy pace

He dreams of a Hindu honeymoon
He doesn't dream that ev'ry night when he goes out
To make an honest rupee
She steps out to make a lotta whoopee

Oh, the love song of the whirling dervish
Has a sweet and tender sound
But will he burn if he ever should learn
That while he's doing her a real good turn
She gives him the runaround

She's got a nervish, throwin' him a curvish
Which, of course, he doesn't deservish

But, baby, it's cold outside
I got to go way
But. Baby, it's cold outside
This evening's has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So I'd  better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Maybe just a half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hand, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride
I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out
Ahh, but it's cold outside

I simply must go
But, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no
But, baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore

Eww, your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

But, baby, you'll freeze out there
See ya, say, lend me a comb

You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand

Johnny Mercer,You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby Lyrics,"
                    You must have been a beautiful baby, 
you must have been a wonderful child
When you were only startin' 
to go to kindergarten 
I bet you drove the little boys wild! 

An' when it came to winning blue ribbons, 
you must have shown the other kids how 
I can see the judge's eyes as they handed you the prize 
I bet you made the cutest bow! 

Oh!, You must have been a beautiful baby, 
'cause baby look at you now 

Does your dad appreciate 
that you are merely great? 
Does your mother realize 
you're such a treat for the eyes? 

You must have been a beautiful baby, 
you must have been a wonderful child 
When you were only startin' 
to go to kindergarten 
I bet you drove the little boys wild! 

An' when it came to winning blue ribbons, 
you must have shown the other kids how 
I can see the judge's eyes as they handed you the prize 
I bet you made the cutest bow! 

Oh!, You must have been a beautiful baby, 
'cause baby look at you now (she's a cutie!)

With Paul Weston and the Pied Pipers
Winter Wonderland
""Now for a little change in pace we've sent Johnny Mercer up to the bandstand to join Paul Weston and the Pied Pipers in the nostalgic song of Christmas time, Winter Wonderland.""
Sleigh bells ring.
Are you listening?
In the lane,
Snow is glistening.
A beautiful sight.
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird;
Here to stay is a new bird.
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?""
We'll say, ""No man.""
But you can do the job when you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream
By the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
We'll pretend our snowman's parson brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?""
We'll say, ""No man.""
But you can do the job
When you're in town.Ooh ooh!
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream
By the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made

 Oh listen, sister, 
 I love my mister man, 
 And I can't tell yo' why, 
 Dere ain't no reason 
 Why I should love dat man. 
 It must be sumpin' dat de angels done plan.

 Fish got to swim, birds got to fly, 
 I got to love one man till I die.

 Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow, 
 Tell me I'm crazy (maybe I know). 
 Can't help lovin' dat man of mine. 
 When he goes away 
 Dat's a rainy day, 
 But when he comes back dat day is fine, 
 De sun will shine! 
 He kin come home as late as kin be, 
 Home widout him ain't no home to me. 
 Can't help lovin' dat man of mine. 
 ~~~ 
 My man is shif'less 
 An' good for nuthin' too 
 (He's mah man jes' de same) 

 He's never round here 
 When dere is work to do. 
 He's never round here when dere's workin' to do. 
 De chimbley's smokin', 
 De roof is leakin' in, 
 But he don't seem to care. 
 He kin be happy 
 Wid jes' a sip of gin. 
 Ah even love him when his kisses got gin!

                    I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

I'm old fashioned

Jerome Kern,Leave It To Jane Lyrics,"
                    Performed by June Allyson)

Leave it to Jane, Jane, Jane
I don't know why you should make me
Ask of a plan from you
She is the girl with brains

I've always tried to do
Every thing I can for you
No problem you can wish
On her, gives her a strain

She'll tackle many a storm, and daily
If something is on your mind
And I can see that there is
Not a doubt of it

Comfort you soon will find
Leave it to me
I can get you out of it
If you have started worrying
Kindly refrain
And just hand over the whole thing to Jane

(Spoken)
Well Jane
Why don't you tell us
How do you do it?
Yes Jane, come on Jane, tell us
Oh well, it's really very simple
I just study up on the famous
Women of history
You mean like Lucrecia Borgia?
Well, no, not exactly, listen
(Note:  Then she goes on to sing Cleopatterer in the movie                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/jerome+kern/ + /j/jerome+kern/leave+it+to+jane_20250214.html
Jerome Kern,Make Believe Lyrics,"
                    Perfromed by Tony Martin and Kathryn Grayson) 

 Verse 1 

 The game of ""just supposing"" is the sweetest game I know, 
 Our dreams are more romantic than the world we see. 
 And if the things we dream about don't happen to be so, 
 That's just an unimportant technicality. 

 Refrain: 

 We could make believe I love you, 
 Only make believe that you love me. 
 Others find peace of mind in pretending; 

 Couldn't you?  Couldn't I?  Couldn't we 
 Make believe our lips are blending 
 In a phantom kiss or two, or three? 
 Might as well make believe I love you, 
 For to tell the truth, I do. 

 Verse 2 

 Your pardon I pray, 'twas too much to say, 
 The words that betray my heart. 
 We only pretend, 
 You do not offend, 
 In playing a lover's part.

Here we all work 'long the Mississippi
Here we all work while the white folk play
Pullin' them boats from the dawn till sunset
Gettin' no rest till the judgment day

Don't look up and don't look down
Ya don't dast make the white boss frown
Bend your knees and bow your head
And pull that rope until you're dead

Let me go 'way from the Mississippi
Let me go 'way from the white man boss
Show me that stream called the River Jordan
That's the old stream that I long to cross
Ol' Man River, that Ol' Man River
He must know somepin', but he don't say nothin'
He just keeps rollin', he keeps on rollin' along

He don't plant taters, and he don't plant cotton
And them what plants 'em is soon forgotten
But Ol' Man River, jest keeps rollin' along

You and me, we sweat and strain
Bodies all achin' and wracked with pain
Tote that barge and lift that bale
Ya get a little drunk and ya lands    in ja-ail

I gets weary and so sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin', but I'm feared of dyin'
And Ol' Man River, he just keeps rollin' along

Jerome Kern,Smoke Gets In Your Eyes Lyrics,"
                    They asked me how I knew my true love was true,
I of course replied, something here inside cannot be denied.
They said someday you'll find all who love are blind,
When your heart's on fire, you must realize,
Smoke gets in your eyes.
So I chaffed and then I gaily laughed,
To think that they could doubt my love,
Yet today, my love has flown away,
I am without my love.
Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide,
So I smile and say when a lovely flame dies,
Smoke gets in your eyes                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/jerome+kern/ + /j/jerome+kern/smoke+gets+in+your+eyes_20255184.html

Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though he's some other place, his face I see

And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my love is there

He dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night

I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
But there's my love
Up above

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""
But I'm so grateful to discover
He's still there

I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor

Brown paper packages tied up with strings...

Door bells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles,
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings...
These are a few of my favorite things.

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes,
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes,
Silver white winters that melt into spring-
These are a few of my favorite things.

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling bad...
I simply remember my favorite things

Uneasy in my easy chair

That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one

You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

Complete for us to
Share together

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
