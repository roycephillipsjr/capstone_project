Aladdin,Prince Ali Lyrics,"
                    Make way for Prince Ali
Say hey! It's Prince Ali

Hey! Clear the way in the old Bazaar
Hey you!
Let us through!
It's a bright new star!
Oh Come!
Be the first on your block to meet his eye!

Make way!
Here he comes!
Ring bells! Bang the drums!
Are you gonna love this guy!

Prince Ali! Fabulous he!
Ali Ababwa
Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee!
Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your sunday salaam
The come and meet his spectacular corterie

Prince Ali!
Mighty is he!
Ali Ababwa
Strong as ten regular men, definitely!
He faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali

He's got seventy-five golden camels
(don't they look lovely june)
Purple peacocks
He's got fifty-three
(fabulous harry, I love the feathers)
When it comes to exotic-type mammals
Has he got a zoo?
I'm telling you, it's a world-class menagerie

Prince Ali! Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa
That physique! How can I speak
Weak at the knee
Well, get on out in that square
Adjust your vein and prepare
To gawk and gravel and stare at Prince Ali!

There's no question this Ali's alluring
Never ordinary, never boring
Everything about the man just plain impresses
He's a winner, he's a whiz, a wonder!
He's about to pull my heart asunder!
And I absolutely love the way he dresses!

He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys
(He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys)
And to view them he charges no fee
(He's generous, so generous)
He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies
(Proud to work for him)
They bow to his whim love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali!

Prince Ali!
Amorous he! Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see
And that, good people, is why he got dolled up and dropped by
With sixty elephants, llamas galore
With his bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers

Aladdin,Are You In Or Out? Lyrics,"
                    Sa'luk:
I remember a time
When crime was sublime
There was plenty of loot in the lair
We'd plunder and pillage
And ransack a village
With nary a worry or care
Then along came this king
With his soft-hearted dream
But he ratted us out in the end
So rally the troops!
We were meant to re-group
And return to our roots once again!
Are you in or out?
Gotta know without a doubt
I'm the one you need for a dirty deed
I'm the best, success is guaranteed
Are you men or mice?
Take a slice of my advice!
You want a fearless leader, one that's strong and stout
Better vote for me
Are you in or out?

Thives:
We used to be smart, yes
Horrendously heartless
In ravaging raids, we were rough
We knew what we had
To be blissfully bad
Then Cassim brought this sensitive stuff!
And we strayed from the path
Of our rigorous wrath
Now we're taking a bath in the dust!
But we'll reclaim our winnings
Our humble beginnings
In turmoil and torture, we trust!

Sa'luk:
Are you in or out?
Double-crossers or devout?
Put your faith in me
Pretty soon you'll see
I'm the prince of generosity
Are you foe or friend?
Here's the path I recommend
You want a ride to fame?
I've got the fastest route;
What's it gonna be?
Thieves:
We'll go robbing in all the right places,
From Agrabah dunes to Bali
Imagine the fear on their faces
When we drop by for cookies and tea

Sa'luk:
Come along, boys!
Follow me!
Are you in or out?
If you're with me, give a shout (Yay!)
I'll lead you all the way
Into the glory days
We'll begin a life of crime that pays

Thieves:
Are you out or in?
Make your choice now, sink or swim!

Sa'luk:
You can stick with me, or stay behind and pout
What's it gonna be?
Consider carefully

Aladdin,A Whole New World Lyrics,"
                    I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
Hold your breath - it gets better
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment red-letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place

Nu kan du selv
Bli' både troldmand og en magisk fyr
Nu har du stød I handsken, dynamit,
Du har en bombe der gåare af på tid
Nu har du punch - slå til -
Juhu - et hit!
Tag bare lampen I din hånd og gnid
Så siger jeg...

Mester Aladdin, sig, hvad ka' jeg gør' for dig?
Lad mig ta' bestilling, skrive ned...

Ha ha ha

Jeg er til for dig

Du har aldrig haft en ven som mig

Du er boss, Mogul og Tzar
Sæt ønsker frem
Og de gåare hjem,
Hva' med en ekstra håndfuld Baklawa?

Frit valg på søjle ""A""
Imens er ""B"" på vej
Ta' hvad du vil for det' jeg til

Nede I din hat?
Kun et enkelt pust
Og se så déare! (ha-ha)
Ka' du så sige abrakadabra?
Sådan her?
Og forsvinde I et gyldent skæare?

Sid ikke der og hæng med ørerne
Jeg sørger for din fredagsbøn bli'are hørt
Jeg åbner portene og dørene
Mit job er garanteret veludført
Jeg venter kun på startsignal fra dig
Sig dine ønsker og jeg gåare I gang
Din ønskeseddel er lang, tror jeg
Så gnid på lampen første gang og så

Aladdin,You're Only Second Rate Lyrics,"
                    I must admit,
Your parlor tricks are amusing
I bet you've got a bunny
Under your hat!
Now here's your chance
To get the best of me,
Hope your hand is hot!
C'mon, clown,
Let's see what you've got!
You can try to slam me
With your hardest stuff
But your double whammy
Isn't up to snuff
I'll set the record straight
You're simply out of date
You're only second rate!
You think your cat's a meanine,
But your tiger's tame
You've got a lot to learn
About the genie game
So for your education,
I'll reiterate
You're only second rate!
Men cower at the power
In my pinky
My thumb is number one
On every list
But if you're not convinced
That I'm invincible,
Put me to the test!
I'd love to lay this rivalry to rest!
Go ahead and zap me
With the big surprise
Snap me in a trap,
Cut me down to size
I'll make a great escape
It's just a piece of cake
You're only second rate!
You know, your hocus-pocus
Isn't tough enough
And your mumbo-jumbo
Doesn't measure up
Let me pontificate
Upon your sorry state
You're only second rate!
Zaba-caba-dabra!
Granny's gonna grab ya!
Alakazam-da-mus
And this thing's bigger than the both of us!
So spare me your tremendous scare!
You look horrendous in your underwear!
And I can hardly wait
To discombobulate
I'll send ya back and packing
In a shipping crate
You'll make a better living
With a spinning plate

Aladdin,One Jump Ahead Lyrics,"
                    [Aladdin:] Gotta keep
One jump ahead of the breadline
One swing ahead of the sword
I steal only what I can't afford
(That's Everything!)

One jump ahead of the lawmen
That's all, and that's no joke
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke

[Crowd:] Riffraff! Street rat! Soundrel! Take that!

[Aladdin:] Just a little snack, guys
[Crowd:] Rip him open, take it back, guys
[Aladdin:] I can take a hint, gotta face the facts
You're my only friend, Abu!
[Crowd:] Who?
Oh, It's sad Aladdin hit the bottom
He's become a a one-man rise in crime
I'd blame parents except he hasn't got 'em
[Aladdin:] Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Tell you all about it when I got the time!

One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom
Next time gonna use a nom de plume
One jump ahead of the hitman
One hit ahead of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll around the block

[Crowd:] Stop, thief! Vandal! Outrage! Scandal!

[Aladdin:] Let's not be too hasty
[Lady:] Still I think he's rather tasty
[Aladdin:] Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Otherwise we'd get along
[Crowd:] Wrong!

[Aladdin:] One jump ahead of the hoofbeats
(Vandal!)
One hop ahead of the hump
(Street rat!)
One trick ahead of disaster
(Scoundrel!)
They're quick, but I'm much faster
(Take that!)
Here goes, better throw my hand in
Wish me happy landin'

Aladdin,There's A Party Here In Agrabah 1 Lyrics,"
                    There's a party here in Agrabah
There's excitement in the air
People pouring in from near and far
'Cause Jasmine and Aladdin are gonna have a weddin'

There's a party here in Agrabah
Ev'rybody will be there
So if you're a pouper or a shah
Do something wilh your hair!

You mustn't wear an outfit that's naughty
A turban that's unravelling just won't do
No earrings that are taste|ess or gaudy
You're gonna |ook gorgeous when I get through
There's a party here in Agrabah
So I'm goin' to paint the town
If you want to see what colors are
Follow me around

Aladdin's gettin' married
And it's gonna be the wedding of the century
My buddy's gettin' married and you're gonna see
Just how much I can do

You've heard of your Safari Bar Mitzvahs
You've all been to a luau sweetsixteen
Well none of them compare to what this is
The food'll be disgusting, by evening you'll be bursting

There's a party here in Agrabah
And it's got us all aglow
If a street rat could have come so far
Maybe I could do it
Sure, there's nothin' to it

There's a party here in Agrabah
But we're not sure that we'll go
For although the bride is ladidah
The groom is awfully low

Now we take you down to the palace
Where ev'ryone has celebrated all night long
Without Jafar and all of his malice
Ev'rybody is happy! What could possibly go wrong?

There's a party here in Agrabah
And we're gonna rob'em blind
While they're all munching caviar
Create a small disturbance
I'll sneak up flom behind

There's a party here in Agrabah
And the loot is pouring in
I like this wedding stuff so far
Maybe if I'm pleasant I'll get to keep a present

We've ordered just a few tasteful flowers
And valets who will carefully park for you
The brides maids have been dressing for hours
Girls you look just lovely and so grown up too

There's a party here in Agrabah
Guests are filling up the room
But there's something missing, Yes, a-ha!

Aladdin,Proud Of Your Boy Lyrics,"
                    Proud of your boy
I'll make you proud of your boy
Believe me, bad as I've been, Ma
You're in for a pleasant surprise

I've wasted time
I've wasted me
So say I'm slow for my age
A late bloomer, Okay, I agree

That I've been one rotten kid
Some son, some pride and some joy
But I'll get over these lousin' up
Messin' up, screwin' up times

You'll see, Ma, now comes the better part
Someone's gonna make good
Cross his stupid heart
Make good and finally make you
Proud of your boy

Tell me that I've been a louse and loafer
You won't get a fight here, no ma'am
Say I'm a goldbrick, a goof-off, no good
But that couldn't be all that I am

Water flows under the bridge
Let it pass, let it go
There's no good reason that you should believe me
Not yet, I know, but

Someday and soon
I'll make you proud of your boy
Though I can't make myself taller
Or smatter or handsome or wise

I'll do my best, what else can I do?
Since I wasn't born perfect like Dad or you
Mom, I will try to
Try hard to make you

Aladdin,Nothing Like A Friend Lyrics,"
                    I parachuted down
Into the Taj Mahal
I rollerbladed
Along the great Great Wall!
I even made the famous
Leaning Tower fall,
But who was with me through it all?
Nobody!
The Moscow Circus
Hired me to fly trapeze
On Mount Olympus,
Ran a race with Hercules
It's easy when you're chased by killer bees!
Who said ""geshundheit"" when I sneezed? *Achoo*
So now I'm home,
Home again with you,
You chase the clouds away
Whenever I am blue

Aladdin:
(""You're always blue!"")

And though the pyramids,
I highly recommend
There is nothing in the world
Quite like a friend!
Slept like a babe in Bombay
On a bed of nails
Moroccans love my daring Dance of Seven Veils
Of seven veils
I single-handedly
I even saved the whales!
No one was there to hear my tales!
In Acapulco,
Joined a Mariachi band
I rode the ragin' rapids
Down the Rio Grande
Flew in a air balloon,
But when I tried to land
Nobody laughed,
Or lent a hand
Without you, the Amazon is
Just a trickle
Without you, the Sahara's
Not so hot
Without you, Niagara Falls
Is just a leaky faucet
The Huey ii
Is just some yacht
Now that I'm home,
Home again, it's clear,
All I ever wanted
Seems to be right here
I've traveled East and West
And now, I'm back again
There is nothing in the world
Quite like a friend...

Aladdin:
There's nothing in the world

Jasmine:
Nothing in the whole wide world

There is nothing in the world
Quite like a friend!
Nothing in the whole wide world!

Aladdin,Out Of Thin Air Lyrics,"
                    You showed me the world when I was all locked up inside
You reached out your hand and took me on
A magic carpet ride
One look at your smile
And I could see the light shining ev'rywhere
People like you don't come out of thin air

You don't understand, there is so much that you don't see
Just think if you can what growing up
Had to be like for me
Your father's a man who taught you who you are
Mine was never there
So how can you say I don't come out of thin air?

There's so much I want to know

If it means I'd have to go
I'll be right here when you return

See our wedding day?
It isn't too late (I've waited so long to learn the truth)

Your father is really there

Aladdin,Father And Son Lyrics,"
                    It's a big bright beautiful future
Thank you your lucky stars, you're alive
You've got someone special to talk to
A friend that you can trust for life

You've been on your own with no family ties
But those solo days are done
You'll be two of a kind
Spending quality time
Together as father and son

Building model ships
Taking fishing trips
Warking hand in hand
Painting the palace and moving the sand
First ten to go, with your daddy-o
Once you break the ice
You can postulate palernal advice

It's a fine fantobulous future
I see fruitt on the family tree
You'll be great as the grumpy old grand-pa
Bouncing babies on your knee
You can fall asleep on the comfy couch
After playing one on one
Dreaming back to back
That you walloped the Shoq
Together as father and son

Maybe a bumpy ride
We'll make it side by side
Good afternoon, I'll be your travel guide
Moreover, Laddie, Make room for Daddy Gotta
Whole new shoulder to cry on

Take a chance now give it a spin
You've had chums for palin' around with
But you've never had a friend like him

Put your checkered past behind you now
No more living on the run
Face the big bright beautiul future

Aladdin,Forget About Love Lyrics,"
                    [Iago:] Forget about that guy
Forget about the way you fell into his eyes
Forget about his charms
Forget about how his handsomeness alarms
Walking on air's obnoxious
The thrill
The chill
Will make you nauseous
And you'll never get enough
Just forget about love!
Forget about romance
Forget about the way your heart begins to dance
Then you feel the blush
When he's spouting out some sentimental mush
Love really is revolting!
It's even worse than when you're sulking
Enough of this fluff!
Just forget about love!
[Jasmine:] I had almost forgotten the way it felt
When he held out his hand for mine
My heart all a-flutter
[Iago:] Oh, how I shudder
[Jasmine:] It was eternal bliss
[Iago:] It won't be missed!
Forget about 'is touch
[Jasmine:] I can't forget about his touch
[Iago:] In the scheme of things,
It doesn't matter much
[Jasmine:] It matters so mu-uch
[Iago:] You're better on your own
A meal becomes a banquet
When you eat alone
[Jasmine:] Hmm-mm-mm-mm
[Both:] Love's filled with compromises
[Iago:] And don't you hate those big surprises?
[Jasmine:] A cozy rendezvous
[Iago:] Oh, please!
[Jasmine:] Candlelight for two
[Iago:] Oh, geez!
[Jasmine:] Look you're calling my bluff!
[Both:] (I can't) (Just) forget about love!

[Jasmine:] I can't forget about my heart
[Aladdin:] I can't forget about my heart
[Jasmine:] And how it felt
To fall for you right from the start
[Aladdin:] I'm still falling
[Jasmine:] Whatever we may do
[Aladdin:] Whatever we may do
[Jasmine:] You are here for me,
And I'll be there for you
[Aladdin:] I'll be there

[Both:] To wish, to want, to wander
To find the sun
Through rain and thunder
[Aladdin:] A cozy rendezvous
[Jasmine:] Yes, please!
[Aladdin:] Candlelight for two
[Iago:] Oh, geez!
Enough is enough!

Aladdin,Friend Like Me Lyrics,"
                    Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves
Scheherezade had a thousand tales
But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeves
You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power in your corner now
Some heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how
See all you gotta do is rub that lamp
And I'll say

Mister Aladdin, sir
What will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order
Jot it down
You ain't never had a friend like me
Ha ha ha

Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'
C'mon whisper what it is you want
You ain't never had a friend like me

Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service
You're the boss
The king, the shah
Say what you wish
It's yours! True dish
How about a little more Baklava?

Have some of column ""A""
Try all of column ""B""
I'm in the mood to help you dude
You ain't never had a friend like me

Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this out their little hat?
Can your friends go, Woo?
Well, looky here
Can your friends go, Abracadabra, let 'er rip
And then make the sucker disappear?

So doncha sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed
I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
You got me bona fide, certified
You got a genie for your chare d'affaires
I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what-cha wish? I really wanna know
You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt
Well, all you gotta do is rub like so - and oh

Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three
I'm on the job, you big nabob
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend

Get mad? Heck no, sir!
Not us, four-strong, a permanent team

Four guys our poundin'
The pavements of Agrabah
Poor guys with one Alabian dream

To stay this lazy
And play like crazy
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

True friends, no phonies
Me and my cronies
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

Four bums, none better
Not one go-getter
Unmontivated in the extreme

Grow up, go earn the city's esteem! ""
We say, ""Tough noogie!
No way! Let's boogie! ""

Four guys out making our music in Baghdad
In Baghdad we're the creme de la creme

Whozat? Guess dummy!

Old pals, none newer,
None tried, none truer
Eight eyes with one impertinent gleam

Four guys out passing the turban in Baghdad
For lettring off some musical stream

Aladdin,High Adventure Lyrics,"
                    Convince those guys, my lord and master
Well, do it faster, let's be gone
In wasting time we court disaster
Pick up that sword and strap it on

Fate blows her kiss
Chills your heart
Takes your hand

Fate feels like this
Play your part
This was planned

And lo, before you know
You grab your horse, you grab ur gear
Your moment's now, your moment's here

It's time for high adventure
You're off and riding saber flashin
Your banner high, your molars gnashing

You feel so dashing on in the air, guys
Get set to give some guy a thrashing
'Cause high adventure's in the air

There's high adventure in the air, guys
Someone's out there, guys, someone bad
He's got a damsel in despair, guys
Heck, that's not fair, guys, and I'm mad

Fate blows her kiss
Winks her eye
Plots her scheme
Plots it for Babkak, Omar, and Kassim

And so
We five will go
Until it's through
Until it ends
Here comes Aladdin and his friends
Off on a
High Adventure

To confrontations so exciting
They're playing music while we're fighting
Scratching and biting on a
High Adventure
Fell that adrenaline igniting
'Cause high adventure's in the air

One more time, it's
High Adventure
Heigh-ho, the stallions are stampeding
With Allah's wisdom ever leading
My finger's bleeding! Well, that's
High Adventure
What we've collectively been needing
Is high adventure in the air

Hark! Something calls like a dream from afar
Calls out to Babkak, Kassim, and Omar
It's -- wait! -- the voice of fate
It calls to me, it calls to you
Abu, Aladdin, and the crew, off on a
High adventure

Danger to Danger we go flying
Completely unafraid of dying
Omar stop crying, this is
High adventure

There's no ignoring or denying
The kind of thrills that it's supplying
And the effect's electrifying

And I don't get no respect

But this busted beak
Is the only thanks that I get!

They promise caviar,
And leave me eatin' dust!
That's some reward for loyalty
From here on in,
I'm lookin' out for me!
Oh, I don't need nobody else
I'll never fail
I'll cover my own tail
I can take care of myself!

You know, it just don't pay
To give a hoot
I'm givin' all my heart
What do I get?

Aladdin,Jafar Lyrics,"
                    Jafar:  Prince Ali
Yes, it is he,
But not as you know him.
Read my lips and come to grips
With reality
Yes, meet a blast from your past
Whose lies were too good to last
Say hello to your precious Prince Ali!
Iago:       Or should we say Aladdin?
Aladdin:    Jasmine, I tried to tell you.

Jafar:  So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin
Just a con, need I go on?
Take it from me
His personality flaws
Give me adequate cause
To send him packing on a one-way trip
So his prospects take a terminal dip
His assets frozen, the venue chosen
Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!
So long,

Beauty and the Beast,Prologue (The Enchantress) Lyrics,"
                    Once upon a time, in a faraway land,
A young Prince lived in a shining castle.
Although he had everything his heart desired,
The Prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind.
But then, one winter's night,
An old beggar woman came to the castle
And offered him a single rose In return for shelter from the bitter cold.
Repulsed by her haggard appearance,
The Prince sneered at the gift,
And turned the old woman away.
But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances,
For Beauty is found within.
And when he dismissed her again,
The old woman's ugliness melted away
To reveal a beautiful Enchantress.
The Prince tried to apologize, but it was too late,
For she had seen that there was no love in his heart.
And as punishment,
She transformed him into a hideous beast,
And placed a powerful spell on the castle,
And all who lived there.
Ashamed of his monstrous form,
The beast concealed himself inside his castle,
With a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.
The Rose she had offered,
Was truly an enchanted rose,
Which would bloom until his twenty-first year.
If he could learn to love another,
And earn her love in return
By the time the last petal fell,
Then the spell would be broken.
If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast
For all time.
As the years passed,

First prize is nearly mine
It's quite my best invention
So simple, yet complex;
So massive, yet so small
This triumph of design
Will be my old-age pension
That is, provided I can find the fair at all
I must have missed a sign...
I should have paid attention...
Drat! (Wolf howls)
That's not a nightingale, and not a mating call.

Beauty and the Beast,No Matter What Lyrics,"
                    Belle

Papa, do you think I'm... Odd?

Maurice

My daughter odd?
Where did you get an idea like that?

Belle

I don't know.
It's just that, well, people talk.

Maurice

They talk about me, too.

Maurice

No, we're not odd, its true
No fam'ly ever saner
Except one uncle who... Well, maybe let that pass
In all you say or do
You couldn't make it plainer
You are your mother's daughter; therefore you are class

Belle

So I should just accept
I'm simply not like them

Maurice

They are the common herd
And you should take my word
You are unique: creme de la creme
No matter what you do
I'm on your side
And if my point of view Is somewhat misty-eyed
There's nothing clearer in my life
Than what I wish and feel for you
And that's a lot...
No matter what

Belle

No matter what they say
You make me proud I love the funny way
You stand out from the crowd

Maurice

It's my intention my invention
Shows the world out there one day
Just what we've got...

Belle

No matter what

Maurice

Now some may say all fathers just exaggerate

Belle

That ev'ry daughter's great?

Maurice

You are!

Belle

And ev'ry daughter tends to say her father's tops

Maurice

She pulls out all the stops
To praise him

Belle

And quite rightly!

Maurice

No matter what the pain
We've come this far I pray that you remain
Exactly as you are
This really is a case of father knowing best

Belle

And daughter too!

Maurice

You're never strange

Belle

Don't ever change

Beauty and the Beast,Me Lyrics,"
                    Gaston

You've been dreaming, just one dream
Nearly all your life
Hoping, scheming, just one theme:
Will you be a wife?
Will you be some he-man's property?
Good news!
That he-man's me!
This equation, girl plus man
Doesn't help just you
On occasion, women can
Have their uses too
Mainly to extend the fam'ly tree
Pumpkin, extend with me!

Gaston

We'll be raising sons galore

Belle

Inconceivable!

Gaston

Each built six foot four!

Belle

Unbelievable!

Gaston

Each stuffed with ev'ry Gaston gene!

Belle

I'm not hearing this!

Gaston

You'll be keeping house with pride!

Belle

Just incredible!

Gaston

Oh so gratified

Belle

So unweddable!

Gaston

That you are a part of this idyllic scene.

(spoken)
Picture this: A rustic hunting lodge, my latest kill roasting over the fire, my little wife massaging my feet, while the little
Ones play on the floor with the dogs. We'll have six or seven!

Belle

Dogs?

Gaston

No, Belle!

Strapping boys... Like me!

Belle

Imagine that!

Gaston

I can see that we will share
All that love implies
We shall be a perfect pair
Rather like my thighs
You are face to face with destiny!
All roads lead to...
The best things in life are...
All's well that ends with me!
Escape me?
There's no way
Certain as ""Do, Re,""
Belle, when you marry....

(spoken)
So Belle, what would it be?
Is it ""yes"", or is it ""oh, yes""?

Belle

I... I just don't deserve you!

True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then some body bends
Unexpectedly

Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared

Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise

Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bitter sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east

Song as old as rhyme

Beauty and the Beast,The Mob Song Lyrics,"
                    [Gaston:]       The Beast will make off with your children.
[Mob:]          {gasp}
[Gaston:]       He'll come after them in the night.
[Belle:]        No!
[Gaston:]       We're not safe till his head is mounted on my wall! I
Say we kill the Beast!
[Mob:]          Kill him!

[Man I:]        We're not safe until he's dead
[Man ii:]       He'll come stalking us at night
[Woman:]        Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
[Man iii:]      He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free
[Gaston:]       So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me

Through the mist
Through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer
Then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast
He's got fangs
Razor sharp ones
Massive paws
Killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar
See him foam
But we're not coming home
'Til he's dead
Good and dead
Kill the Beast!

[Belle:]        No! I won't let you do this!
[Gaston:]       If you're not with us, you're against us!
Bring the old man!
[Maurice:]      Get your hands off me!
[Gaston:]       We can't have them running off to warn the creature.
[Belle:]        Let us out!
[Gaston:]       We'll rid the village of this Beast. Who's with me?
[Mob:]          I am! I am! I am!)

Light your torch
Mount your horse
[Gaston:]       screw your courage to the sticking place
[Mob:]          We're counting on Gaston to lead the way
Through a mist
Through a wood
Where within a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see ev'ry day
It's a beast
One as tall as a mountain
We won't rest
'Til he's good and deceased
Sally forth
Tally ho
Grab your sword
Grab your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go!

[Gaston:]       We'll lay siege to the castle and bring back his head!
[Belle:]        I have to warn the Beast! This is all my fault! Oh, Papa,
What are we going to do?
[Maurice:]      Now, now, we'll think of something.

[Mob:]          We don't like
What we don't understand
In fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns
Bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the Beast!

[Cogsworth:]    I knew it! I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up.
[Lumiere:]      Maybe it would have been better if she had never come at all.
Could it be?
[Mrs Potts:]    Is it she?
[Lumiere:]      Sacre Bleu! Invaders!
[Cogsworth:]    Encroachers!
[Mrs Potts:]    And they have the mirror!
[Cogsworth:]    Warn the Master! If it's a fight they want, we'll be
Ready for them! Who's with me?
[Gaston:]       Take whatever booty you can find. But remember, the
Beast is mine!

[Objects:]      Hearts ablaze
Banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger just increased
[Mob:]          Raise the flag
Sing the song
Here we come, we're fifty strong
And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong
Let's kill the Beast!

[Mrs Potts:]    Pardon me, Master.
[Beast:]        Leave me in peace.
[Mrs Potts:]    But sir! The castle is under attack!

[Mob:]          Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast

[Lumiere:]      This isn't working!
[Featherduster:] Oh Lumiere, we must do something!
[Lumiere:]      Wait, I know!)

[Mob:]          Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

[Mrs Potts:]    What shall we do, Master?
[Beast:]        It doesn't matter now. Just let them come.

I wonder why I didn't see it there before

I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No it can't be
I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before

[Belle] New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see

[Lumiere] Well, who'd have thought?
[Mrs Potts] Well, bless my soul

[Cogsworth] Well, who'd have known?
[Mrs Potts] Well, who indeed?
[Lumiere] And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?
[Mrs Potts] It's so peculiar. Wait and see

Ha ha, oui, my friends.
The day we have waited for may be at hand!

Mrs. Potts

Oh, only if that were true, Lumiere!

Lumiere

Aaah... Human again

Mrs. Potts

Human again

Lumiere

Yes, think of what that means!

Lumiere

I'll be cooking again
Be good-looking again
With a mademoiselle on each arm
When I'm human again
Only human again
Poised and polished and gleaming with charm...
I'll be courting again
Chic and sporting again

Mrs. Potts

Which should cause sev'ral husbands alarm!

Chip

I'll hop down off this shelf

Lumiere

And toute suite be myself

Chip

I can't wait to be human again

Mme. De la grande bouche, mrs. Potts, babette

When we're human again
Only human again
When we're knickknacks and whatnots no more

Chip

Little push, little shove
They could whoosh fall in love

Mme. De la grande bouche

Ah, cherie, won't it all be top-drawer
I'll wear lipstick and rouge
And I won't be so huge
Why, I'll easily fit through that door
I'll exude savior-faire
I'll wear gowns!
I'll have hair!
It's my prayer to be human again

Cogsworth

When I'm human again
Only human again
When the world once more making sense
I'll unwind for a change

Lumiere

Really? That'd be strange!

Cogsworth

Can I help it if I'm t-t-tense?
In a shack by the sea
I'll sit back sipping tea
Let my early retirement commence
Far from fools made of wax
I'll get down to brass tacks and relax

All

When I'm human again
So sweep the dust from the floor!
Let's let some light in the room!
I can feel, I can tell
Someone might break the spell
Any day now!

Lumiere

Shine up the brass on the door!

Babette

Alert the dustpail and the broom!

All

If all goes as planned
Our time may be at hand
Any day now!

Mrs. Potts, egg timer, whisk

Open the shutters and let in some air

Mrs. Potts

Put these here and put those over there

All

Sweep up the years
Of sadness and tears
And throw them away!

Belle

When Guinevere heard that Arthur was slain, she went away to a convent, and no one could make her smile again. The
End.

Beast

What a beautiful story

Belle

Oh, I knew you would like it!
I would like to ask you something

Beast

What's that?

Belle

A second chance.
Would you have dinner with me tonight?

Beast

Huh? Me? You?
Well, that would be, I mean -- Oh, yes!!

All

When we're human again
Only human again
When the girl fin'lly sets us all free
Cheeks a-bloomin' again
We're assumin' again
We'll resume our long lost joie de vie
We'll be playin' again
Holiday' again
And we're prayin' it's A-S-A-P
When we cast off this pall
We'll stand straight, we'll walk tall
When we're all that we were
Thanks to him, thanks to her
Coming closer and closer
And closer and...

We'll be dancing again!
We'll be twirling again!
We'll be whirling around with such ease
When we're human again
Only human again
We'll go waltzing those old one-two-threes
We'll be floating again!
We'll be gliding again!
Stepping, striding as fine as you please
Like a real human does
I'll be all that I was
On that glorious morn
When we're fin'lly reborn
And we're all of us human again!

How long must this go on?
This cruel trick of fate?

And then the witch was gone
And left me in this state
An object of revulsion and derision
Hated...
Is there no one
Who can show me

Beauty and the Beast,Home Lyrics,"
                    *Home*

Yes, I made the choice
For papa I will stay
But I don't deserve to lose my freedom in this way
You monster!

If you think that what you've done is right
Well then... you're a fool
Think again

Is this home?
Is this where I should learn to be happy?
Never dreamed
That a home could be
Dark and cold I was told
Every day in my childhood
Even when we grow old
Home will be where the heart is
Never were words so true
My heart's far, far away
Home is too.

Is this home?
Is this what I must learn to believe in?
Try to find something good
In this tragic place
Just in case
I should stay here forever
Held in this empty space
Oh, but that won't be easy
I know the reason why
My heart's far, far away
Home's a lie
What I'd give
To return
To the life that I knew lately
But I know that I can't
Solve my problems going back

Is this home?
Am I here for a day or forever?
Shut away from the world until
Who knows when
Oh but then
As my life has been altered once it can change again
Build higher walls around me
Change every lock and key
Nothing lasts, nothing holds all of me

My heart's far, far away
Home, and free.

A dangerous pastime,

But that wacky old coot is Belle's father,
And his sanity's only ""so-so"".

Since I looked at that loony old man.

And right now I'm evolving a plan!

Takes cheap shots like Gaston,
Plans to persecute harmless crackpots like Gaston.

Ev'ry day
Like the one before
Little town
Full of little people
Waking up to say:

TOWNSFOLK

Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!

There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Ev'ry morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town

BAKER

Good Morning, Belle!

BELLE

Good morning, Monsieur.

BAKER

And where are you off to, today?

BELLE

The bookshop.
I just finished the most wonderful story
About a beanstalk and an ogre and a -

BAKER

That's nice. Marie!
The baguettes!
Hurry up!

Look there she goes that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

Good morning, sir.
I've come to return the book I borrowed.

Finished already?

BELLE

Oh, I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new?

BOOKSELLER

Not since yesterday.

BELLE

That's all right.
I'll borrow . . . . . this one!

BOOKSELLER

That one?
But you've read it twice!

BELLE

Well, it's my favorite!
Far off places, daring swordfights, magic spells, a prince in disguise -

If you like it all that much, it's yours!

BELLE

But sir!

BOOKSELLER

I insist.

BELLE

Thank you.
Thank you very much!

Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

BELLE

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my fav'rite part because --- you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

Now it's no wonder that her name means ""Beauty""
Her looks have got no parallel

SHOPKEEPER

But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd

Very diff'rent from the rest of us

She's nothing like the rest of us

And no girl, for that matter.

And I've got my sights set on that one.

She's the one - the lucky girl I'm going to marry.

I know, but -

GASTON

That makes her the best.
And don't I deserve the best?

LEFOU

Of course you do!

GASTON

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes Isn't he dreamy?

Oh he's so cute!
Be still my heart I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

Beauty and the Beast,Be Our Guest Lyrics,"
                    LUMIERE

Ma chere, Mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight.
And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents - your dinner!

Be our guest! Be our guest!
Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie
And we'll provide the rest
Soup du jour
Hot hors d'oeuvres
Why, we only live to serve
Try the gray stuff
It's delicious!

Don't believe me? Ask the dishes!
They can sing, they can dance
After all, Miss, this is France
And a dinner here is never second best
Go on, unfold your menu
Take a glance and then you'll
Be our guest
Oui, our guest
Be our guest!

LUMIERE AND CHORUS

Beef ragout
Cheese souffle
Pie and pudding ""en flambe""

LUMIERE

We'll prepare and serve with flair
A culinary cabaret!
You're alone
And you're scared
But the banquet's all prepared
No one's gloomy or complaining
While the flatware's entertaining
We tell jokes!
I do tricks
With my fellow candlesticks

CHORUS

And it's all in perfect taste
That you can bet
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass
To be out guest

LUMIERE

If you're stressed
It's fine dining we suggest

CHORUS

Be our guest! Be our guest! Be our guest!

LUMIERE

Life it so unnerving
For a servant who's not serving
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon
Ahh those good ol' days when we were useful
Suddenly those good ol' days are gone
10 years we've been rusting
Needing so much more than dusting
Needing exercise, a chance to use our skill
Most days we just lay around the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy you walked in and oopsie daisy

MRS. POTTS

It's a guest! It's a guest!
Sakes alive, well I'll be blessed!
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed
With dessert, she'll want tea
And my dear that's fine with me
While the cups do their soft-shoein'
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing
I'll get warm, piping hot
Heaven's sakes! Is that a spot?
Clean it up! We want the company impressed

CHORUS

We've got a lot to do!

MRS. POTTS

Is it one lump or two?
For you, our guest!

CHORUS

She's our guest!

MRS. POTTS

She's our guest!

CHORUS

She's our guest!
Be our guest! Be our guest!
Be our guest!


CHORUS

Be our guest! Be our guest!
Our command is your request
It's been years since we've had anybody here
And we're obsessed
With your meal, with your ease
Yes, indeed, we aim to please
While the candlelight's still glowing
Let us help you,
We'll keep going
Course by course, one by one
'Til you shout, ""Enough! I'm done!""
Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up
Be our guest! Be our guest!
Be our guest!

Beauty and the Beast,As Long As There's Christmas Lyrics,"
                    Don't look inside a stocking
Don't look under the tree
The one thing we're looking for
Is something we can't see
Far more precious than silver
And more splendid than gold
Is something to treasure
But is something we can't hold

As long as there's Christmas
I truly believe
That hope is the greatest of the gifts
We'll receive (we'll receive)

As we all pray together
It's the time to rejoice
And though we may look different
We are singing with one voice

As Long As there's Christmas
I truly believe
That hope is the greatest of the gifts
We'll recieve

There is more (so much more)
To this time of year (to this time of year)
Than sleigh bells and holly
Mistletoes and snow
Those things will come and go
Come and goooo

As long as there is Christmas
I truly do believe that
Hope is the greatest of the gifts
We will receive (we'll receive)

As Long As there's Christmas
I truly believe (I truly believe)
That hope is the greatest of the gifts
We'll recieve

That Hope Is the Greatest gift we'll receive!

Beauty and the Beast,A Gift To You (Beauty And The Beast - One Magical Lyrics,"
                    Belle:
If I could give a gift to you
To hold to your heart dear
I'd give the Christmas memories
To hold throughout the year.

And when you have them all, I think
There's something more I'd bring
The gift of Christmas laughter now
So you could learn to sing...

La la la la, it's Christmas time
Memories everywhere
Singing of hope, peace to mankind
And love is in the air.

And every foolish notion leads to feelings that might start
To make the prayers the children pray
Come true in all our hearts...

Beast:
If you could give a gift to me
To hold to my soul dear
I'd love to see you smile upon my face,
Without a fear

And when you've smiled your fear away
There's something more you'd bring
The gift of gifts, remembering
How I first learned to sing...

Both:
La la la la, it's Christmas time
Memories everywhere
Singing of hope, peace to mankind
And love is in the air.

And every foolish notion leads to feelings that might start
To make the prayers the children pray
Come true in all our hearts...

Beauty and the Beast,If I Can't Love Her Lyrics,"
                    If I Can't Love Her

Beast:
And in my twisted face
There's not the slightest trace
Of anything that even hints of kindness
And from my tortured shape
No comfort, no escape
I see, but deep within is utter blindness

Hopeless
As my dream dies
As the time flies
Love a lost illusion
Helpless
Unforgiven
Cold and driven
To this sad conclusion

No beauty could move me
No goodness improve me
No power on earth, if I can't love her
No passion could reach me
No lesson could teach me
How I could have loved her and make her love me too
If I can't love her, then who?

Long ago I should have seen
All the things I could have been
Careless and unthinking, I moved onward

No pain could be deeper
No life could be cheaper
No point anymore, if I can't love her
No spirit could win me
No hope left within me
Hope I could have loved her and that she'd set me free
But it's not to be
If I can't love her
Let the world be done with me.

Beauty and the Beast,Gaston Lyrics,"
                    Gaston

Who does she think she is?
That girl has tangled with the wrong man!

Lefou

Darn right.

Gaston

No one says ""no"" to Gaston!
Dismissed! Rejected!
Publicly humiliated!
Why, it's more than I can bear.

Lefou

More beer?

Gaston

What for? Nothing helps.
I'm disgraced.

Lefou

Who, you? Never!
Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.

Lefou

Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston
Looking so down in the dumps
Ev'ry guy here'd love to be you, Gaston
Even when taking your lumps
There's no man in town as admired as you
You're ev'ryone's favorite guy
Ev'ryone's awed and inspired by you
And it's not very hard to see why

No one's slick as Gaston
No one's quick as Gaston
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston's
For there's no man in town half as manly
Perfect, a pure paragon!
You can ask any Tom, dick or Stanley
And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on

Lefou and chorus

No one's been like Gaston
A king pin like Gaston

Lefou

No one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston

Gaston

As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating!

Lefou and chorus

My what a guy, that Gaston!
Give five ""hurrahs!"" Give twelve ""hip-hips!""

Lefou

Gaston is the best
And the rest is all drips

Chorus

No one fights like Gaston
Douses lights like Gaston

Lefou

In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston!

Bimbettes

For there's no one as burly and brawny

Gaston

As you see I've got biceps to spare

Lefou

Not a bit of him's scraggly or scrawny

Gaston

That's right!
And ev'ry last inch of me's covered with hair

Chorus

No one hits like Gaston
Matches wits like Gaston

Lefou

In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston

Gaston

I'm espcially good at expectorating!
Ptoooie!

Chorus

Ten points for Gaston!

Gaston

When I was a lad
I ate four dozen eggs
Ev'ry morning to help me get large
And now that I'm grown
I eat five dozen eggs
So I'm roughly the size of a barge!

Chorus

Oh, ahhh, wow!
My what a guy, that Gaston!
No one shoots like Gaston
Makes those beauts like Gaston

Lefou

Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston

Gaston

I use antlers in all of my decorating!

Beauty and the Beast,Theres Something There Lyrics,"
                    Belle:
There's something sweet
And almost kind
But he was mean
And he was course
And unrefined
And now he's dear
And so I'm sure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

Beast:
She glanced this way
I thought I saw
And when we touched
She didn't shudder at my paw
No it can't be
I'll just ignore
But then shes never looked at me that way before

Belle:
New and a bitalarming
Whod have ever thought that this could be
True that he's no prince charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see

Lumiere:
Well who'd have thought

Mrs. Potts:
Well bless my soul

Cogsworth:
Well who'd have known

Mrs. Potts:
Well who indeed

Lumiere:
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own

Mrs. Potts:
Its so peculiar

Mrs. Potts, Cogsworth, Lumiere
We'll  wait and see a few days more
There may be something there that wasnt there before

Cogsworth:
Well perhaps there's something there that wasnt there before

Mrs. Potts:
There may be something there that wasnt there before                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beauty+and+the+beast/ + /b/beauty+and+the+beast/theres+something+there_20598803.html,0,1,belle there's something sweet and almost kind but he was mean and he was course and unrefined and now he's dear and so i'm sure i wonder why i didn't see it there before beast she glanced this way i thought i saw and when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw no it can't be i'll just ignore but then shes never looked at me that way before belle new and a bitalarming whod have ever thought that this could be true that he's no prince charming but there's something in him that i simply didn't see lumiere well who'd have thought mrs potts well bless my soul cogsworth well who'd have known mrs potts well who indeed lumiere and who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own mrs potts its so peculiar mrs potts cogsworth lumiere we'll wait and see a few days more there may be something there that wasnt there before cogsworth well perhaps there's something there that wasnt there before mrs potts there may be something there that wasnt there before,belle there s something sweet and almost kind but he was mean and he was course and unrefined and now he s dear and so i m sure i wonder why i didn t see it there before beast she glanced this way i thought i saw and when we touched she didn t shudder at my paw no it can t be i ll just ignore but then shes never looked at me that way before belle new and a bitalarming whod have ever thought that this could be true that he s no prince charming but there s something in him that i simply didn t see lumiere well who d have thought mrs potts well bless my soul cogsworth well who d have known mrs potts well who indeed lumiere and who d have guessed they d come together on their own mrs potts its so peculiar mrs potts cogsworth lumiere we ll wait and see a few days more there may be something there that wasnt there before cogsworth well perhaps there s something there that wasnt there before mrs potts there may be something there that wasnt there before

Cole Porter,"I Love Paris, Song (from ""Can Can"") Lyrics","
                    Every time I look down on this timeless town
Whether blue or gray be her skies.
Whether loud be her cheers or soft be her tears,
More and more do I realize:

I love Paris in the springtime.
I love Paris in the fall.
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles,
I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles.

I love Paris every moment,
Every moment of the year.
I love Paris, why, oh why do I love Paris?
Because my love is near.

Cole Porter,I'm A Gigolo Lyrics,"
                    I should like you all to know,
I'm a famous gigolo.
And of lavender, my nature's got just a dash in it.
As I'm slightly undersexed,
You will always find me next
To some dowager who's wealthy rather than passionate.
Go to one of those night club places
And you'll find me stretching my braces
Pushing ladies with lifted faces 'round the floor.
But I must confess to you
There are moments when I'm blue.
And I ask myself whatever I do it for.

I'm a flower that blooms in the winter,
Sinking deeper and deeper in snow.
I'm a baby who has
No mother but jazz,
I'm a gigolo.
Ev'ry morning, when labor is over,
To my sweet-scented lodgings I go,
Take the glass from the shelf
And look at myself,
I'm a gigolo.
I get stocks and bonds
From faded blondes
Ev'ry twenty-fifth of December.
Still I'm just a pet
That men forget
And only tailors remember.
Yet when I see the way all the ladies
Treat their husbands who put up the dough,
You cannot think me odd

Cole Porter,Love For Sale Lyrics,"
                    When the only sound on the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belong to a lonesome cop
I open shop
The moon so long has been gazing down
On the warward ways of this wayward town
Her smile becomes a smirk, I go to work
Love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled
Love that's only slightly soiled
Love for sale
Who will buy
Who would like to sample my supply
Who's prepared to pay the price
For a trip to paradise
Love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love
In their childish ways
I know every type of love
Better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
I've been through the mill of love
Old love
New love
Every love but true love

Appetizing young love for sale

Cole Porter,"I'm In Love Again, Song (from ""Greenwich Village Follies"") Lyrics","
                    Why am I Just as happy as a child
Why am I Like a racehorse running wild
Why am I In a state of ecstasy
The reason is 'cause something's happened to me

I'm in love again, and the spring is comin'
I'm in love again, hear my heart strings strummin'
I'm in love again, and the hymn I'm hummin'
Is the ""Huddle Up, Cuddle Up Blues""

I'm in love again, and I can't rise above it
I'm in love again, and I love, love, love it
I'm in love again, and I'm darn glad of it
Good news!

Someone sad had the awful luck to meet
Someone bad, but the kind of bad that's sweet
No one knows what a glimpse of paradise
Someone who's naughty showed to someone who's nice

I'm in love again, and with glee I bubble
I'm in love again, and the fun's just double
I'm in love again, if I got in trouble
I'll be cursin' one person I know

I'm in love again, I'm a lovebird sigin'
I'm in love again, I'm the spring lamb springin'
I'm in love again, weddin' bells are ringin'

Cole Porter,In The Still Of The Night Lyrics,"

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Way out on the rim of the hill

Cole Porter,Let's Do It Lyrics,"
                    When the little bluebird
Who has never said a word
Starts to sing Spring
When the little bluebell
At the bottom of the dell
Starts to ring Ding dong Ding dong
When the little blue clerk
In the middle of his work
Starts a tune to the moon up above
It is nature that is all
Simply telling us to fall in love

And that's why birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Cold Cape Cod clams, 'gainst their wish, do it
Even lazy jellyfish do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

I've heard that lizards and frogs do it
Layin' on a rock
They say that roosters do it
With a doodle and c***

Some Argentines, without means do it
I hear even Boston beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

When the little bluebird
Who has never said a word
Starts to sing Spring spring spring
When the little bluebell
At the bottom of the dell
Starts to ring Ding ding ding
When the little blue clerk
In the middle of his work
Starts a tune

The most refined lady bugs do it
When a gentleman calls
Moths in your rugs they do it
What's the use of moth balls

The chimpanzees in the zoos do it,
Some courageous kangaroos do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Cole Porter,I Hate Men Lyrics,"
                    I hate men.
I can't abide them even now and then.
Then ever marry one of them, I'd rest a maiden rather,
For husbands are a boring lot that only give you bother.
Of course, I'm awful glad that mother had to marry father,
Still, I hate men.
Of all the types of men I've met in our democracy,
I hate the most the athlete with his manner bold and brassy.
He may have hair upon his chesst, but sister, so has Lassie!
Oh, I hate men!
I hate men.
There worth upon this earth I can not tend
Avoid the traffic sales men atempting Tom he maybe
From China he will bring you jade and perfume from Arabi
But don't forget tis he wholl have the fun and be the baby
Oh I Hate men
If thou shouldst wed a business man, be wary, oh be wary:
He'll tell you he's detained in town on business neccesary.
The business is the business that he gives his secretary!
Oh, I hate men!
I hate men.
Though roosters they, I will not play the hen.
If you espouse an older man through girlish optimism,
He'll always stay at home and night and make no criticism.
Though you may call it love, the doctors call it rheumatism.
Oh, I hate men!
Of all I've read, alone in bed, from A to Zed about 'em,
Since love is blind, then from the mind, all womankind should rout 'em.
But, ladies, you must answer too, what would we do without 'em?

Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.
She is sorry to be delayed,
But last evening down in Lover's Lane she strayed.
Madam.
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.

When she woke up and found, that her dream of love was gone.
Madam.
She ran to the man who had lead her so far astray.
And from under a velvet gown,
She drew a gun and shot her lover down,
Madam.
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.

When the mob came and got her and dragged her from the jail,
Madam,
They strung her from the old willow cross the way.
And the moment before she died,
She lifted up her lovely head and cried,
Madam.

Cole Porter,Night And Day Lyrics,"
                    Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip, drip drip of the rain drops
When the summer showers through
A voice within me keeps repeating
You, you, you

Night and day you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Wheather near to me or far it's no matter darling
Where you are
I think of you
Day and night, night and day
Why is it so that this longing for you
Follows where ever I go
In the roaring trffics boom, in the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day, day and night
Under the hyde of me, theres an oh such a hungry yearning
Inside of me
And this torment wont be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you

Cole Porter,Paris Loves Lovers Lyrics,"
                    Gaze on the glistening lights below and above
Oh, what a night of nights for people in love
No city but this my friend, no city I know
Gives romance such a chance to grow and grow

Paris loves lovers, for lovers it's heaven above
Paris tells lovers, love is supreme, wake up your dream and make love
Only in Paris one discovers the urge to merge with the splurge of the spring
Paris loves lovers for lovers know that love is everything

Paris loves lovers, for lovers it's heaven above

Only in Paris one discovers the urge to merge with the splurge of the spring

Cole Porter,You're The Top Lyrics,"
                    At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed,
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty
At least it'll tell you
How great you are.

You're the top!
You're the Coliseum.
You're the top!
You're the Louver Museum.
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss
You're a Bendel bonnet,
A Shakespeare's sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile,
You're the Tower of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic.
On the other hand, babe, you shine,
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine
Down my spine.
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans
Might think that your song is bad,
But I got a notion
I'll second the motion
And this is what I'm going to add;

You're the top!
You're Mahatma Gandhi.
You're the top!
You're Napoleon Brandy.
You're the purple light
Of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gallery
You're Garbo's salary,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime,
You're turkey dinner,
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop
But if, baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top!
You're an arrow collar
You're the top!
You're a Coolidge dollar,
You're the nimble tread
Of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama,

You're Whistler's mama!

You're camembert.

You're a rose,
You're Inferno's Dante,

You're the nose
On the great Durante.
I'm just in a way,
As the French would say, ""de trop"".
But if, baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top!
You're a dance in Bali.
You're the top!
You're a hot tamale.
You're an angel, you,
Simply too, too, too diveen,
You're a Boticcelli,
You're Keats,
You're Shelly!

You're Ovaltine!
You're a boom,
You're the dam at Boulder,
You're the moon,
Over Mae West's shoulder,
I'm the nominee of the G. O. P.

Or gop!

But if, baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top!
You're a Waldorf salad.
You're the top!
You're a Berlin ballad.
You're the boats that glide
On the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're an old Dutch master,

You're Lady Astor,
You're broccoli!
You're romance,
You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants, on a Roxy usher,
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,

But if, baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

We might make a team
But so wild a scheme
I must banish
For each time I start
To open my heart

Where lotuses smile
And our time beguile
Going native
But how can we go
Unless you are co

So near and yet so far

First so near, then again so far

On clinches galore with me
When fate steps in on the scene
And mops up the floor with me
No wonder I'm a bit under par
For you're so near and yet so far

Cole Porter,Well Did You Evah! Lyrics,"
                    I have heard among this clan,
You are called the forgotten man
(Is that what they're saying, well did you evah!)
(What a swell party this is)

And have you heard the story of,
A boy, a girl, unrequited love
(Sounds like pure soap opera, tune in tomorrow) I
May cry
(What a swell party this is)

(What frills, what frocks) What broads!
(What furs, what rocks!) They're bootiful.
(Why I've never seen such gaity) Neither have I.
(Its all just too, too risque really)

This french champagne (domestic)
(So good for the brain) that's what I was going to
Say.
(You know you're a brilliant fellow?) Why thank
You
(Pick up jack. Please don't eat that glass my friend)

(Have you heard, about dear Blanche?)
(Got run down by an avalanche) No!
(Oh don't worry, she's a game girl you know, got
Up and finished 4th)
The kids got guts. (Having a nice time? Grab a
Line!)

Have you heard that Mimsie Starr (what now)

She got pinched in the Astor bar
(Sloshed again, eh?) She was stoned.
Well, did you evah? (Never!)
What a swell party this is!

Hey, check out that act! (That's a lovely dress.
You think I can talk her out of it?)

It's great, (aah it's great)
So grand! (so grand)
It's wonderland!
La da da da...

(We sing), oh we sing
(So rare) so rare
(Like old camembert)
(Like baba au rhum!)
Don't dig that kind of crooning chum!

Have you heard? It's in the stars
Next July we collide with Mars.
Well, did you evah?
What a swell party, a swell party
A swelligant, elegant party this is!

(I drink to your health)
Naw, lets drink to your wealth
Your my bon ami
Hey, that's french
A liberty fraternity

Have you heard? It's in the stars
Next July we collide with Mars.
Well, did you evah?

Cole Porter,I Get A Kick Out Of You Lyrics,"
                    My story is much too sad to be told,
But practically everything
Leaves me totally cold.
The only exception I know is the case,
When I'm out on a quiet spree,
Fighting vainly the old enui
And I suddenly turn and see,
Your fabulous face.
I get no kick from Champagne
Mere alchohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick
Out of you
Some get a kick from cocain
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrificly too
Yet I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me you obviously don't
Adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high
With some guy in the sky is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick
Out of you                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter//c/cole+porter/i+get+a+kick+out+of+you_20209574.html,1,0,my story is much too sad to be told but practically everything leaves me totally cold the only exception i know is the case when i'm out on a quiet spree fighting vainly the old enui and i suddenly turn and see your fabulous face i get no kick from champagne mere alchohol doesn't thrill me at all so tell me why should it be true that i get a kick out of you some get a kick from cocain i'm sure that if i took even one sniff that would bore me terrificly too yet i get a kick out of you i get a kick every time i see you standing there before me i get a kick though it's clear to me you obviously don't adore me i get no kick in a plane flying too high with some guy in the sky is my idea of nothing to do yet i get a kick out of you,my story is much too sad to be told but practically everything leaves me totally cold the only exception i know is the case when i m out on a quiet spree fighting vainly the old enui and i suddenly turn and see your fabulous face i get no kick from champagne mere alchohol doesn t thrill me at all so tell me why should it be true that i get a kick out of you some get a kick from cocain i m sure that if i took even one sniff that would bore me terrificly too yet i get a kick out of you i get a kick every time i see you standing there before me i get a kick though it s clear to me you obviously don t adore me i get no kick in a plane flying too high with some guy in the sky is my idea of nothing to do yet i get a kick out of you
Cole Porter,What Is This Thing Called Love Lyrics,"
                    I was a humdrum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my humdrum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again
What is this thing called love
This funny thing
Called love
Just who can solve it's mystery
Why should it make
A fool of me?
I saw you there
One wonderful day
You took my heart
And threw it away
That's why I ask the lord
In heaven above
What is this thing
Called love?
What is this thing called love
This funny thing
Called love
Just who can solve it's mystery
Why should it make
A fool of me?

Cole Porter,Where Is The Life That Late I Led? Lyrics,"
                    Since I reached the charming age of puberty
And began to think of feminine curls
Like a show that's typically Shuberty
I have always had a multitude of girls
But now that a married man at last am I
How aware of my dear departed past am I
Where is the life that late I led?
Where is it now? Totally dead!
Where is the fun I used to find?
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!
A married life may all be well
But raising an heir could never compare
With raising a bit of hell
So I repeat what first I said
Where is the life that late I...
In dear Milano, where are you Momo?
Still selling those pictures of the scriptures in the duomo
And Carolina, where are you, 'lina?
Still peddling your pizza in the streets-a Toremina
And in Firenze, where are you Alice?
Still there in your pretty itty-bitty pity palace
And sweet Lucretia, so young and gay
What scandalous doings in the ruins of Pompeii
Where is the life that late I led?
Where is it now? Totally dead!
Where is the fun I used to find?
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!
The marriage game is quite all right
Yes during the day it's easy to play
But oh what a bore at night
So I repeat what first I said
Where is the life that late I...
Where is Rebecca? My Becky-wecky-oh
Could still she be cruising that amusing Pontevecchio?
Where is Fedora, the wild virago?
It's lucky I missed her gangster sister from Chicago
Where is Venetia, who loved to chat so?
Could still she be drinking in her stinking pink palazzo?
And lovely Lisa, where are you Lisa?
You gave a new meaning to the Leaning Tower of Piza
Where is the life that late I led?
Where is it now? Totally dead!
Where is the fun I used to find?
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!
I've oft been told of nuptial bliss
But what do you do at quarter to two
With only a shrew to kiss?
So I repeat what first I said

Won't you turn that new leaf over
So your baby can be your slave?

Where we two can go and try settlin’ down
There I’ll care for you forever
Well, at least till you dig my grave, oh

Cole Porter,My Heart Belongs To Daddy Lyrics,"
                    I used to fall in love with all those boys who maul the young cuties
But now I find I'm more inclined to keep my mind on my duties.

While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
'cause my heart belongs to Daddy.

If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more
But my heart belongs to Daddy

Yes my heart belongs to Daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
So I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know you're perfectly swell
But my heart belongs to Daddy
'Cause my Daddy he treats it so well

There was a dame that a football game
Made long for the strong undergraddie
I never dream of making the team
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy

Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy

Cole Porter,I Concentrate On You Lyrics,"

Trouble begins to brew
Whenever the winter winds become too strong
I concentrate on you

When fortune cries ""Nay, nay"" to me
And people declare ""You're through""
Whenever the blues become my only songs
I concentrate on you

On your smile, so sweet, so tender

When at first my kiss you do decline
On the light in your eyes when you surrender
And once again our arms intertwine

And so when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true
To prove that even the wise men can be wrong

The sweet of you, the pure of you
The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you
The east, west, north and the south of you

And handle even the heart and soul of you

For I love all of you

Cole Porter,All Through The Night Lyrics,"
                    The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end;
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're so close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,
You're never there at all!
I know you've forsaken me
Till the shadows fall;
But then once again I can dream, I've the right
To be close to you all through the night.

Cole Porter,Anything Goes Lyrics,"
                    Times have changed,
And we've often rewound the clock,
Since the Puritans got a shock,
When they landed on Plymouth Rock.
If today,
Any shock they should try to stem,
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock,
Plymouth Rock would land on them.
In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking,
But now, God knows,
Anything Goes.
Good authors too who once knew better words,
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose, Anything Goes.
The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today,
And black's white today,
And day's night today,
When most guys today
That women prize today
Are just silly gigolos
And though I'm not a great romancer
I know that I'm bound to answer
When you propose,
Anything goes
When grandmama whose age is eighty
In night clubs is getting matey with gigolo's,
Anything Goes.
When mothers pack and leave poor father
Because they decide they'd rather be tennis pros,
Anything Goes.
If driving fast cars you like,
If low bars you like,
If old hymns you like,
If bare limbs you like,
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like,
Why, nobody will oppose!
When every night,
The set that's smart
Is intruding in nudist parties in studios,
Anything Goes.
The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today,
And black's white today,
And day's night today,
When most guys today
That women prize today
Are just silly gigolos
And though I'm not a great romancer
I know that I'm bound to answer

Cole Porter,Begin The Beguine Lyrics,"
                    When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green
I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine
To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part
What moments divine, what rapture serene
The clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean
So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine
O yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more: ""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know what heaven we're in

Cole Porter,"Blow, Gabriel, Blow Lyrics","
                    Brothers and sisters, we are here tonight to fight the devil.
Do you hear that playin'?
Yes I hear that playin'.
Do you know who's playin'?
No who is that playin'?
Why it's Gabriel, Gabriel playin',
Gabriel, Gabriel saying,
Will you be ready to go when I blow my horn?

Oh blow, Gabriel blow,
Go an' blow, Gabriel blow,
I've been a sinner', I've been a skank
And now I'm willin' to trim my lamp
So blow, Gabriel blow.
I've been low, Gabriel low,
Mighty low, Gabriel low,
But now since I have seen the light
I'm good by day and I'm good by night
So blow, Gabriel blow.
[Verse:]
Once I was headed for hell,
Once I was headed for hell,
But when I got to Satan's door,
I heard you blowin' on your horn once more
So I said ""Satan, farewell.""
And now I'm all ready to fly,
Just to fly higher and higher,
'cause I've been through brimstone,
And I've been through the fire,
And I've perched my soul,
And my heart too,
So climb up the mountain top and start to
Blow, Gabriel blow,
Go on an' blow, Gabriel blow,
I want to join your happy band,
And play all day in the promised land
So blow, Gabriel blow.
Come on you scamps, get up you sinners,
You're all too full of expensive dinners,
Stand up on your lazy feet and sing!

                    Down In The Depths""
by Cole Porter
With a million neon rainbows burning below me,
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar,
Here I sit, above the town,
In my pet-paillated gown,
Down in the depths
Of the ninetieth floor.
While the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet,
And the bars are packed with couples calling for more,
I'm deserted and depressed
In my regal-eagle nest,
Down in the depths
Of the ninetieth floor.
When the only one you wanted wants another,
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?
Why, even the janitor's wife
Has a perfectly good love life,
And here I am, facing tomorrow,
Alone in my sorrow,
Down in the depths
Of the ninetieth floor                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter//c/cole+porter/down+in+the+depths+on+the+ninetiethhellip_20455861.html,1,0,down in the depths by cole porter with a million neon rainbows burning below me and a million blazing taxis raising a roar here i sit above the town in my pet-paillated gown down in the depths of the ninetieth floor while the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet and the bars are packed with couples calling for more i'm deserted and depressed in my regal-eagle nest down in the depths of the ninetieth floor when the only one you wanted wants another what's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore why even the janitor's wife has a perfectly good love life and here i am facing tomorrow alone in my sorrow down in the depths of the ninetieth floor,down in the depths by cole porter with a million neon rainbows burning below me and a million blazing taxis raising a roar here i sit above the town in my pet paillated gown down in the depths of the ninetieth floor while the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet and the bars are packed with couples calling for more i m deserted and depressed in my regal eagle nest down in the depths of the ninetieth floor when the only one you wanted wants another what s the use of swank and cash in the bank galore why even the janitor s wife has a perfectly good love life and here i am facing tomorrow alone in my sorrow down in the depths of the ninetieth floor

And gaze at the moon till I lose my senses

Cole Porter,Easy To Love Lyrics,"
                    Good, good morning, so good to see you weren't just a dream of mine
Real as a raven, real as thunder, real as the sun shinin'
But still so very undefined
Can't imagine what's behind those sleepy eyes
Little stranger, don't try to hide now
You look so young when you're afraid
There is no danger, but from the devil
He may want you, but I'm in his way
You don't know how easy it is
You don't know how easy it is to love you

Cole Porter,Find Me A Primitive Man Lyrics,"
                    Now, before this modern idea had burst
About the women and children first,
The men had much more charm than they have today.
And if only one of that type survived,
The very moment that he arrived,
I know I'd fall in love in a great big way.
I can't imagine being bad
With any Arrow collar ad,
Nor could I take the slightest joy
In waking up a college boy.
I've no desire to be alone
With Rudy Vallee's megaphone,
So when I'm saying my prayers, I say:

Find me a primitive man,
Built on a primitive plan.
Someone with vigor and vim.
I don't mean a kind that belongs to a club,
But the kind that has a club that belongs to him.
I could be the personal slave
Of someone just out of a cave.
The only man who'll ever win me
Has gotta wake up the gypsy in me,
Find me a primitive man,
Find me a primitive man.

Trouve moi un homme primitif
Trouve moi un garcon naif.
Quelqu'un tout plein de vigeur,
Ces p'tits maquereaux qu'on appelle gigolos ne
Pourraient jamais donner le vrai bonheur.
J'ai besoin d'un bel animal
Pour chauffeur mon chaffage centrale.
Et l'homme qui me veut pour capitane
Devrait reveiler mon sang tzigane,
Trouve moi un homme primitif, vif,
Trouve moi un homme primitif.

(Find me a primitive man,
Find me a forthright young lad,
Someone with vigor to spare,
Those fatuous beaux they call gigolos could never give me happiness.
I must have a gorgeous beast
To heat up my own central heat.
And he who aspires to be my stud
Must reawake my gypsy blood.
Find me a primitive man.)

Cole Porter,"Down In The Depths (On The Ninetieth Floor)- Ballard, Kaye Lyrics","
                    Down In The Depths""
by Cole Porter

With a million neon rainbows burning below me,
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar,
Here I sit, above the town,
In my pet-paillated gown,
Down in the depths
of the ninetieth floor.
While the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet,
And the bars are packed with couples calling for more,
I'm deserted and depressed
In my regal-eagle nest,
Down in the depths
of the ninetieth floor.
When the only one you wanted wants another,
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?
Why, even the janitor's wife
Has a perfectly good love life,
And here I am, facing tomorrow,
Alone in my sorrow,
Down in the depths
of the ninetieth floor                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter//c/cole+porter/down+in+the+depths+on+the+ninetieth+floor+ballard+kaye_20191645.html,1,0,down in the depths by cole porter with a million neon rainbows burning below me and a million blazing taxis raising a roar here i sit above the town in my pet-paillated gown down in the depths of the ninetieth floor while the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet and the bars are packed with couples calling for more i'm deserted and depressed in my regal-eagle nest down in the depths of the ninetieth floor when the only one you wanted wants another what's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore why even the janitor's wife has a perfectly good love life and here i am facing tomorrow alone in my sorrow down in the depths of the ninetieth floor,down in the depths by cole porter with a million neon rainbows burning below me and a million blazing taxis raising a roar here i sit above the town in my pet paillated gown down in the depths of the ninetieth floor while the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet and the bars are packed with couples calling for more i m deserted and depressed in my regal eagle nest down in the depths of the ninetieth floor when the only one you wanted wants another what s the use of swank and cash in the bank galore why even the janitor s wife has a perfectly good love life and here i am facing tomorrow alone in my sorrow down in the depths of the ninetieth floor
Cole Porter,"Don't Look At Me That Way, Song (from ""Paris"") Lyrics","
                    Oh, I'm so mad about a lad
It's too deep to express
And when he tries to use his eyes
They have instant success
So full of passion, these pupils are
That girls forget what their scruples are
So when he turns them on me
I murmur tenderly

I think you're great, I think you're grand
And I don't mind if you hold my hand
But don't look at me that way

Your kisses, too, are heavenly
And oh, so full of variety
But don't look at me that way

When you tell me sweetly you're mine completely
I always give a long cheer
But those sudden flashes behind your lashes
Are nobody's business, dear

Since you began to play your role
I've lost my heart and I've lost my soul
But as for losing my self-control
Don't look at me that way

I just adore your loving arms
In fact, they're two of your greatest charms
But don't look at me that way

I'm very mild, I'm very meek
My will is strong, but my won't is weak
So don't look at me that way

When that strange expression of indiscretion
Begins to show in your stare
There's a hocus-pocus about your focus
That gives me a terrible scare

I feel a thrill when you arrive
And while you're near I simply thrive
But if you want to get home alive
Don't look at me that way                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter//c/cole+porter/dont+look+at+me+that+way+song+from+paris_21150503.html,1,0,oh i'm so mad about a lad it's too deep to express and when he tries to use his eyes they have instant success so full of passion these pupils are that girls forget what their scruples are so when he turns them on me i murmur tenderly i think you're great i think you're grand and i don't mind if you hold my hand but don't look at me that way your kisses too are heavenly and oh so full of variety but don't look at me that way when you tell me sweetly you're mine completely i always give a long cheer but those sudden flashes behind your lashes are nobody's business dear since you began to play your role i've lost my heart and i've lost my soul but as for losing my self-control don't look at me that way i just adore your loving arms in fact they're two of your greatest charms but don't look at me that way i'm very mild i'm very meek my will is strong but my won't is weak so don't look at me that way when that strange expression of indiscretion begins to show in your stare there's a hocus-pocus about your focus that gives me a terrible scare i feel a thrill when you arrive and while you're near i simply thrive but if you want to get home alive don't look at me that way,oh i m so mad about a lad it s too deep to express and when he tries to use his eyes they have instant success so full of passion these pupils are that girls forget what their scruples are so when he turns them on me i murmur tenderly i think you re great i think you re grand and i don t mind if you hold my hand but don t look at me that way your kisses too are heavenly and oh so full of variety but don t look at me that way when you tell me sweetly you re mine completely i always give a long cheer but those sudden flashes behind your lashes are nobody s business dear since you began to play your role i ve lost my heart and i ve lost my soul but as for losing my self control don t look at me that way i just adore your loving arms in fact they re two of your greatest charms but don t look at me that way i m very mild i m very meek my will is strong but my won t is weak so don t look at me that way when that strange expression of indiscretion begins to show in your stare there s a hocus pocus about your focus that gives me a terrible scare i feel a thrill when you arrive and while you re near i simply thrive but if you want to get home alive don t look at me that way

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

And a cosy cottage by the sea?
How'd'ya like to dress in silk and satin?

And invite the Vanderbilts to tea?
Everything on which you've got your heart set
Baby, have a little dream on me

Paris in the Spring, Miami in the Fall
Interviews and pictures in the press
What a way to speak on twenty bucks a week
Don't forget that Rockefeller started out on less

Everything we touch will turn to clover
In the magic land of what's to be
But until your baby puts it over
Baby, have a little dream on me

Be sure it's true when you say ""I love you""
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of heart have been broken
Just because these words were spoken

I love you, yes I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure it's true when you say ""I love you""
It's a sin to tell a lie

Monologue: Now, ya better be sure that it's true when you say ""I LUV ya.""
Honey chile, don'tcha know it's a sin to tell a lie? Whole lotta hearts have been
Broken. Ya know why they were broken? Just for these foolish little words that
Were spoken. Ya know what they were? ""I LUV ya, I LUV ya."" Darlin', ya know
Doggone well I love ya and if ya break my heart I've got to die. So ya better be
Sure that it's true when you come runnin' up here sayin' ""I LUV ya"" 'cause it's a sin
To tell a lie.

I love you, yes I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure it's true when you say ""I love you""

Fats Waller,Two Sleepy People Lyrics,"
                    Here we are
Out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning
Look how late it gets
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight

Here we are
In the cozy chair
Picking on a wishbone
From the Frigidaire
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
And too much in love to break away

Do you remember
The nights we used to linger in the hall?
Father didn't like you at all
Do you remember
The reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest
And get a bit of rest

Well, here we are
Just about the same
Foggy little fella
Drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/f/fats+waller/ + /f/fats+waller/two+sleepy+people_20330769.html,1,0,here we are out of cigarettes holding hands and yawning look how late it gets two sleepy people by dawn's early light and too much in love to say goodnight here we are in the cozy chair picking on a wishbone from the frigidaire two sleepy people with nothing to say and too much in love to break away do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall father didn't like you at all do you remember the reason why we married in the fall to rent this little nest and get a bit of rest well here we are just about the same foggy little fella drowsy little dame two sleepy people by dawn's early light and too much in love to say goodnight,here we are out of cigarettes holding hands and yawning look how late it gets two sleepy people by dawn s early light and too much in love to say goodnight here we are in the cozy chair picking on a wishbone from the frigidaire two sleepy people with nothing to say and too much in love to break away do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall father didn t like you at all do you remember the reason why we married in the fall to rent this little nest and get a bit of rest well here we are just about the same foggy little fella drowsy little dame two sleepy people by dawn s early light and too much in love to say goodnight
Fats Waller,Take It Easy Lyrics,"
                    Take it easy, be a sport
Just remeber life is short
If you've got to take it
Take it easy
Never hurry to a date
Eat your supper; let 'em wait
Don't get indegestion
Take it easy
Go stick your chest out
And rest out
Of doors in the sun
Lay off
You'll pay off
In plenty of fun
So don't be one to tear your hair
If your girl gives you the air
If she makes you take it,
Take it easy!

Fats Waller,That Old Feeling Lyrics,"
                    Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill

When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

                    Truckin'
Fats Waller
(Ted Koehler / Rube Bloom)

We had to have something new,
A dance to do,
Up here in Harlem,
So, everyone start Truckin'.

As soon as the news got 'round,
The folks downtown,
Came up to Harlem,
Saw everbody Truckin'.

It didn't take long
Before the high-hats were doing it,
'Park Avenuing' it,
All over town,
You see them shufflin', shufflin', shufflin' down.

It spread like a forest blaze,
Became a craze,
Thanks to Harlem now,
Everybody's Truckin'.

It didn't take long

Fats Waller,In My Solitude Lyrics,"
                    In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

- words and music by Mann Holiner, Alberta Nichols, Sammy Cahn,
Saul Chaplin and L. E. Freeman
- as recorded in New York, August 1, 1936, by Fats Waller & his Rhythm

I'd work for you, I'd even slave for you
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you (whatever that is)
And if that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along

I'd gladly move the earth for you
To prove my love, dear, and it's worth for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do (gotta do)
Until the real thing comes along

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you, darling, come what may
My heart is yours, what more can I say?
(You want me to rob a bank? Well I won't do it)

I'd sigh for you, yes, I'd even cry for you, yes
I'd tear the stars down from the skies for you
If that isn't love, well skip it, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along

Listen baby
I'd even sigh for you, I'm 'bout ready to cry for you
I'd tear the stars down from the skies for you
If that isn't love, it'll have to do, baby, yes
Until the real thing comes along

Fats Waller,Willow Tree Lyrics,"
                    Let me be your weeping willow tree
Surround you with my long limbs
My dear, let me grow in the shade
In the sands by the bank of your river
Let I drink from your streams
The cool breeze fill my leaves

We will sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

I wish I was a weeping willow tree
I wish I was a weeping willow tree

I wish I was a weeping willow tree
Sweet river caress how softly
Stir my searching roots
Shading the sun in the summers heat
Let I cool you
We have been dancing so long
In the winters freeze and the summers drought
We survive
We belong
Let us sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

I wish I was your weeping willow tree
I wish I was a weeping willow tree
I wish I was a weeping willow tree

Let us sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

Let us sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

We can sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

Let me be

Fats Waller,You're Not The Kind Lyrics,"
                    You're not the kind of a boy for a girl like me, 
I'm just a song and a dance, you're a symphony! 
I thought that you never would doubt me, 
But I'm tellin' you you'd be much better off without me! 

You're just the kind of a boy who would always play fair, 
I'm just the kind of a girl who would never be square; 
It's so hard to let you go, 
But it's only because I know

That you're not the kind of a boy for a girl like me.

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Fats Waller,Basin Street Blues Lyrics,"
                    Won't you come along with me
To the Mississippi
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Steam down the river, down to New Orleans

The band's there to meet us
Old friends there to greet us
Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

Basin Street is the street
Where the best folks always meet
In New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems,
Or just how much it really means

Glad to be, oh yes-sirree
Where welcome's free and dear to me
Where I can lose, lose my Basin Street Blues

Fats Waller,Beale Street Blues Lyrics,"
                    I've seen the lights of gay Broadway,
Old Market Street down by the Frisco Bay,
I've strolled the Prado, I've gambled on the Bourse;
The seven wonders of the world I've seen,
And many are the places I have been,
Take my advice, folks, and see Beale Street first!

You'll see pretty browns in beautiful gowns,
You'll see tailor-mades and hand-me-downs,
You'll meet honest men, and pick-pockets skilled,
You'll find that business never ceases 'til somebody gets killed!

If Beale Street could talk, if Beale Street could talk,

Married men would have to take their beds and walk,
Except one or two who never drink booze,
And the blind man on the corner singing ""Beale Street Blues!""

I'd rather be there than any place I know,
I'd rather be there than any place I know,
It's gonna take a sergeant for to make me go!

I'm goin' to the river, maybe by and by,
Yes, I'm goin' to the river, maybe by and by,
Because the river's wet, and Beale Street's done gone dry!

Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?

No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue

I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?

I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin

Tell me, what did I do?

Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell

How I won you I shall never never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and night time give me sigh
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care?
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush on you

Show her!

How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee!

Change her mind about me!

Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Fats Waller,Handful Of Keys Lyrics,"
                    I like to tinkle on an old piana
I like to play it in a subtle mannah
I get a lot of pleasure
With a spano' keys
Underneath my finger tips
Tricklin' off o' my lips

A handful of keys
And a song to sing
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive
I repeat what I said before

I like to sing a little tune that's mellah
I like to vocalize
There's nothin' swellah
I love to have a supple melody
Just tricklin' off o' my lips

A handful of keys
And a song to sing
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive
I repeat what I said before

I like to tinkle on an old piana

Fats Waller,Honeysuckle Rose (A Jam Session At Victor) Lyrics,"
                    Every honey bee fills with jealousy,
when they see you out with me.

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
and I know the reason why.

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar,
You just have to touch my cup.
You're my sugar.
It's sweeter when you stir it up.

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
seems the honey fairly drips.

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar,
You just have to touch my cup.

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

George Gershwin,Swanee Lyrics,"
                    Intro verse:
I've been away from you a long time.
I never thought I'd miss you so.
Somehow I feel your love is real
Near you I long to be.
The birds are singin', it is song time
The banjos strummin' soft and low.
I know that you yearn for me too.
Swanee, You're calling me.

Chorus:
Swanee,
How I love ya, how I love ya
My dear old Swanee!
I'd give the world to be
Among the folks in
D-I-X-I-E-ven now my
Mammy's
Waitin' for me, prayin' for me
Down by the Swanee.
The folks up north won't see me no more
When I go to that Swanee Shore!

George Gershwin,The Babbitt And The Bromide Lyrics,"
                    A babbitt met a bromide on the avenue one day,
And held a conversation in their own peculiar way;

They both were solid citizens, they both had been around,
And as they spoke you clearly saw their feet were on the ground!

Hello!
How are you?
How's the folks?
What's new?
I'm great!
That's good!
Huh-huh!
Touch wood!
Well well!
what say?
How've you been?
Nice day!
How's things?
What's new?
That's fine!
How are you?


Nice weather we are having, but it gives me such a pain,
I've brought my umbrella so of course it doesn't rain!

Well, hey'ho!
That's life!
What's new?
How's the wife?
Got to run!
Oh my!
Ta-ta!
Olive oil!
Goodbye!

Ten years went quickly by for both these subste-antial men,
And then it happened that one day they chanced to meet again!

That they had both developed in ten years there was no doubt,
And so of course they had an awful lot to talk about!

Hello!
How are you?
How's the folks?
What's new?
I'm great!
That's good!
Huh-huh!
Touch wood!
Well well!
what say?
How've you been?
Nice day!
How's things?
What's new?
That's fine!
How are you?

I seem to know your face but I just can't recall your name!

Well how've you been old boy?  You're looking just about the same!

Well, hey'ho!
That's life!
What's new?
How's the wife?
Got to run!
Oh my!
Ta-ta!
Olive oil!
Goodbye!


Before they met again, some twenty years they had to wait;
This time it happened up above, inside Saint Peter's gate!

A harp each one was carrying, and both were wearing wings,
and this is what they said as they were strumming on the strings;

Hello!
How are you?
How's the folks?
What's new?
Got to run!
Oh my!
Ta-ta!
Olive oil!

George Gershwin,"The Half Of It, Dearie, Blues Lyrics","
                    Each time you trill a song with Bill or look at Will
I get a chill, I'm gloomy
I won't recall the names of all the men who fall
It's all appalling to me
Of course, I really cannot blame them a bit
For you're a hit where're you flit
I know it's so, but dearie, oh!
You'll never know the blues that go right through me
I've got the you-don't-know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues
The trouble is you have so many from whom to choose
If you should marry Tom, Dick, or harry,
Life would be the bunk, I'd become a monk
I've got the you-don't know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues!

To Bill and Ben I'd pay attention now and then
But really men would bore me
When I'd begun to think I'd run and be a nun
I met the one man for me
And now just when the sun is starting to beam
Along comes a girl, zip goes a dream!
What will I do away from you?
I feel the future will be blue and stormy
I've got the you-don't-know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues
It may be my heart isn't broken, but there's a bruise.
Through you I've known some days that were lonesome
Though you say that i'm flirting all the time
I've got the you-don-t know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues!

I've got the you-don't-know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues
Oh, how i wish you'd drop an anchor and end your cruise
You're just a duffer who makes me suffer
All the younger set says your heart's to let

George Gershwin,The Man I Love Lyrics,"
                    When the mellow moon begins to beam,
Ev'ry night I dream a little dream,
And of course Prince Charming is the theme,
The he for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
For/To me it's clear
That he'll appear.
Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong,
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.
He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand ;
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand ;
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not ;
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day
He'll build a little home
Just meant for two,
From which I'll never roam,
Who would - would you ?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love.

George Gershwin,The Physician Lyrics,"
                    Once I loved such a shattering physician,
Quite the best looking doctor in the state,
He looked after my physical condition
And his bedside manner was great!

When I'd gaze up and see him there above me,
Looking less like a doctor than a Turk,
I was tempted to whisper, ""Do you love me,
Or do you merely love your work?""

He said my bronchial tubes were entrancing,
My epiglottis filled him with glee,
He simply loved my larynx
And went wild about my pharynx,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my epidermis was darling
And found my blood as blue as can be,
He went through wild ecstatics
About my lymphatics,
But he never said he loved me.

And though, no doubt, it was not very smart of me,
I get on a-wracking of my soul,
to figure out why he loved every part of me,
And yet not me as a whole.

By my esophagus he was ravished,
Enthusiastic to a degree,
He said 'twas just enormous,
My appendix vermiformis,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my cerebellum was brilliant,
And my cererum far from N G,
I know he thought a lotta
My medulla oblogota,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my maxillaries were marvels,
And found my sternum stunning to see,
He did a double hurdle
When I shook my pelvic girdle,
But he never said he loved me.

He seemed amused,
When he first made a test of me
To further his medical art;
Yet he refused,
When he's fixed up the rest of me,
To cure that ache in my heart.

I know he thought my pancreas perfect,
And for my spleen was keen as can be,

George Gershwin,They All Laughed Lyrics,"
                    The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from Missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from histry I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned
They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly
They told marconi
Wireless was a phony
Its the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune
They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
But ho, ho, ho!
Whos got the last laugh now?
They all laughed at Rockefeller center
Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar
Ford and his misery
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are
They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, ""hello, goodbye.""
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie
They all said wed never get together
Darling, lets take a bow
For ho, ho, ho!
Whos got the last laugh?
He, hee, hee!
Lets at the past laugh
Ha, ha, ha!
Whos got the last laugh now?

George Gershwin,The Moon Is On The Sea Lyrics,"
                    A woman's touch, a woman's touch
The magic of Aladdin couldn't do as much
She's a wizard, she's a champ
And she doesn't need a lamp

A woman's touch can weave a spell
The kind of hocus pocus that she does so well
With the magic of a broom
She can mesmerize a room

With a whisk whisk here and a whisk whisk there
And a dustpan for the cinders
With a rub rub here and a rub rub there
She can polish up the winders

Then presto chango 
Suddenly, the sun comes shining through
And what does Mr Sunshine say to you?
How d'you do?

It makes you blink, to stop and think
A woman and a whisk-broom 
Can accomplish so darn much
So never under-estimate a woman's touch

A woman's touch can quickly fill
The empty flower boxes on a window sill
One smile from her and zoom
Little buds begin to bloom  

A touch of paint, a magic nail
Can turn a kitchen chair into a Chippendale
Even make the lamp appear
Like a crystal chandelier

With a tack tack here and a tack tack there
And a hand around a hammer
With a mop mop here and a mop mop there
You can give a cabin glamour

Then gosh, almighty, all at once
The cabin that we knew
Becomes a shining castle built for two
Me and you

The pies and cakes a woman bakes
Can make a fella tell her 
That he loves her very much

Didn't care what I was headed for.
Time was standing still,
No one counted till
There came a knocking at the door.
Love walked right in and drove the shadows away;
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day.
One magic moment, and my heart seemed to know
That love said ""Hello !"",
Though no a word was spoken.
One look and I forgot the gloom of the past;
One look and I had found my future at last.

George Gershwin,Someone To Watch Over Me Lyrics,"
                    There's a saying old says that love is blind,
Still we're often told, ""Seek and ye shall find.""
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind.
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet;
He's the big affair I cannot forget.
Only man I ever think of with regret.
I'd like to add his initials to my monogram.
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?
Chorus:
There's a somebody I'm longing to see,
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me.
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood.
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me.
Although he may not be the man some girls think of as handsome.
To my heart he carries the key.
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed,
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone who'll watch over me.

Hereand there and yonder,
Wasting precious time
For no reason or rhyme?

Isn't it a crime!

Everything is splendid;
Meeting you today
Has given me a wonderful idea 
Here I stay!

It's a funny thing;
I look at you,
I get a thrill I never knew,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

Here we are at last,
It's like a dream,
The two of us, a perfect team,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

You with the neighbours,
I at silly labours!
What joys untasted,
You readin Heine,
Me somewhere in China!

That I'm for you and you're for me,
And it's such a pity we never, never met before!

Fishing for salmon,
Losing at backgammon!
What joys untasted,
My nights were sour,
Spent with Schopenhauer!

From millionaires to caddies
Would be to capture me !
But you had such persitence,
You wore down my resistance :
I fell, and it was swell
You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you, I shall never, never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view.
I've got a crush on you, Sweetie pie.
All the day and night-time, hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion
Could you coo?
Could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share?
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you

George Gershwin,I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles (interpolated Into The Passing Show Of 1918 Lyrics,"
                    I'm dreaming dreams, I'm scheming schemes
I'm building castles high
They're born anew, their days are few
Just like a sweet butterfly
And as the daylight is dawning
They come again in the morning

I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
Nearly reach the sky
Then like my dreams they fade and die
Fortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air

When shadows creep, when I'm asleep
To lands of hope I stray
Then at daybreak, when I awake
My bluebird flutters away

George Gershwin,I'll Build A Stairway To Paradise Lyrics,"
                    Verse One
All you preachers
Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.
It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;
Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practise,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go...
Chorus
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way!
I've got theblues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes! Go on and carry me there!
I'll build a stairway toparadise
With a new step ev'ry day.
Verse Two
Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.
In time you'll getsaint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise;
Let me give you advice.

George Gershwin,I Got Rhythm Lyrics,"
                    Days can be sunny,
With never a sigh;
Don't need what money can buy.
Birds in the tree sing
Their dayful of song,
Why shouldn't we sing along?
I'm chipper all the day,
Happy with my lot.
How do I get that way?
Look at what I've got:
I got rhythm
I got music
I got my man/girl
Who could ask for anything more?
I got daisies
In green pastures,
I got my man/girl
Who could ask for anything more?
Ol'Man Trouble,
I don't mind him.
You won't find him
'Round my door.
I got starlight,
I got sweet dreams,
I got my man/girl,
Who could ask for anything more?

George Gershwin,Fascinating Rhythm/Liza Lyrics,"
                    Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm 
That pit-a-pats through my brain; 
So darn persistent, 
The day isn't distant 

When it'll drive me insane. 
Comes in the morning 
Without any warning, 
And hangs around me all day. 

I'll have to sneak up to it 
Someday, and speak up to it. 
I hope it listens when I say: 

Fascinating rhythm, 
You've got me on the go! 
Fascinating rhythm, 
I'm all a-quiver. 

When a mess you're making! 
The neighbours want to know 
Why I'm always shaking 
Just like a flivver. 

Each morning I get up with the sun 
Start a-hopping, 
Never stopping 
To find at night no work has been done. 

I know that 
Once it didn't matter 
But now you're doing wrong; 
When you start to patter 

I'm so unhappy. 
Won't you take a day off? 
Decide to run along 
Somewhere far away off  

And make it snappy! 
Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be!

Oh won't you stop picking on me?

George Gershwin,Crazy For You Lyrics,"
                    Swaying room as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one

I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

*Chorus*
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's so brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
two to two we need no words at all

Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

*Chorus*
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's so brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss (2x)
Because I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know its true
I never wanted anyone like this its so brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you

When you know it's true you know im crazy for you
And its so brand new, you know im crazy for you

George Gershwin,Clap Yo' Hands Lyrics,"

Gather around, you children,
And we will lose that evil spirit
Called the Voodoo, Voodoo!

Nothing but trouble if he has found,
If he has found you, children!
But you can chase the hoodoo
With the dance that you do, you do.

Let me lead the way,
There's a new belief today,
But he'll never hound you;
Stamp on the ground, you children, come on!

Clap your hands!  Slap your thigh!
Hallelujah!  Hallelujah!
Everybody come along and join the jubilee!

Clap your hands!  Slap your thigh!
Don't you lose time!  Don't you lose time!
Come along, it's ""Shake your shoes"" time
Now for you and me!

On the sands of time
You are only a pebble,
Don't forget that!
But remember, trouble must be treated
Just like a rebel;
Then send him to the Devil!

George Gershwin,But Not For Me Lyrics,"
                    Old Man Sunshine, listen, you,
Never tell me dreams come true,
Just try it, and I'll start a riot,
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare,
Ever tell me she will care,
I'm certain, It's the final cutain.

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell me fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love, but not for me,
A lucky star's above, but not for me,
With love to lead the way,
I found more skys of grey,
Than any Russian play could guarantee.

I was a fool to fall, and get that way,
Hi ho! Alas! And also Lack a day!
Although I can't dismiss,
The memory of her kiss,
I guess she's not for me.

It all began so well, but what an end,
This is the time a fella needs a friend,
When every happy plot,
Ends in a marriage knot,
And there's no knot for me.

George Gershwin,Begin The Beguine Lyrics,"
                    When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

George Gershwin,Aren't You Kind Of Glad We Did? Lyrics,"
                    Oh, it really wasn't my intention
To disregard convention
It was just an impulse
That had to be obeyed.

Though it seems convention we've been scorning
I'll still not go in mourning
Though my reputation
Is blemished, I'm afraid.

With just one kiss
What heaven, what rapture, what bliss

Honestly, I thought you wouldn't.
Naturally, you thought you couldn't.
And probably we shouldn't.
But aren't you kind of glad we did?

Actually, it all was blameless.
Nevertheless, they'll call it shameless
So let's keep the lady nameless
But aren't you kind of glad we did?

Socially, I'll be an outcast
Obviously, we dined alone
On my good name there will be doubt cast
With never a sign of any chaperon.

No matter how they may construe it
Whether or not, we have to rue it
Whatever made us do it
Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?

From Monte Carlo to Reno,
They tell you that a beginner
Comes out a winner.
Beginner fishing for flounder
Will catch a seventeen pounder;
That's what I've always heard
And always thought absurd,
But now I believe every word!

For I've got beginner's luck;
The first time I'm in love
I'm in love with you,
Gosh I'm lucky!

I've got beginner's luck;
There never was such a smile
Or such eyes of blue,
Gosh I'm fortunate!

This thing we've begun
Is much more than a pastime,
For this time is the one
Where the first time is the last time!

I've got beginner's luck,
Lucky through and through,
For the first time that I'm in love,
I'm in love with you!

I've got beginner's luck;
The first time I'm in love
I'm in love with you,
Gosh I'm lucky!

I've got beginner's luck;
They told me beginners win,
Now I know it's true,
Gosh I'm fortunate!

This thing we've begun
Is much more than a pastime,
For this time is the one
Where the first time is the last time!

But I'm all a-thrill.

Your divine appeal?
You can never guess
All the love I feel
From now on, Lady/Darling, I insist,
For me no other girls/guys exist.

George Gershwin,It's De-Lovely Lyrics,"
                    The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si. 

The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.

George Gershwin,How Long Has This Been Going On? Lyrics,"
                    As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my anties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.
So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! , how I lost out!

I could cry salty tears;
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt;
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Clombus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendez-vous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

George Gershwin,Somebody Loves Me Lyrics,"
                    When this world began
It was Heaven's plan
There should be a girl for ev'ry single man.
To my great regret
Someone has upset
Heaven's pretty progamme for we've never met.
I'm clutching at straws, just because
I may meet him/her yet.

Somebody loves me, I wonder who,
I wonder who he/she can be.
Somebody loves me, I wish I knew,
Who can he/she be worries me.
For ev'ry boy/girl who passes me I shout, "" Hey, maybe
You were meant to be my loving baby. ""

George Gershwin,Let's Call The Whole Thing Off Lyrics,"
                    Things have come to a pretty pass, 
Our romance is growing flat,
For you like this and the other
While I go for this and that.
Goodness knows what the end will be;
Oh, I don't know where I'm at...
It looks as if we two will never be one, 
Something must be done.

You say either and I say eyether,
You say neither and I say nyther;
Either, eyether, neither, nyther,
Let's call the whole thing off!

You like potato and I like potatoe,
You like tomato and I like tomatoe; 
Potato, potatoe, tomato, tomatoe!
Let's call the whole thing off!

But oh! If we call the whole thing off,
Then we must part.
And oh! If we ever part,
Then that might break my heart!

So, if you like pyjamas and I like pyjahmas,
I'll wear pyjamas and give up pyjahmas.
For we know we need each other, 
So we better call the calling off off.

Let's call the whole thing off!
You say laughter and I say lawfter,
You say after and I say awfter;
Laughter, lawfter, after, awfter,

Let's call the whole thing off!
You like vanilla and I like vanella,
You, say s'parilla and I say s'parella;
Vanilla, vanella, chocolate, strawberry!

Let's call the whole thing off!
But oh! If we call the whole thing off,
Then we must part.
And oh! If we ever part, 

Then that might break my heart!
So, if you go for oysters and I go for ersters
I'll order oysters and cancel the ersters.
For we know we need each other, 

So we better call the calling off off!

George Gershwin,Life Is Just A Bowl Of Cherries Lyrics,"
                    People are queer, they're always crowing, scrambling and rushing about;
Why don't they stop someday, address themselves this way?
Why are we here? Where are we going? It's time that we found out.
We're not here to stay; we're on a short holiday.

Life is just a bowl of cherries.
Don't take it serious; life's so mysterious.
You work, you save, you worry so,
But you can't take your dough when you go, go, go.
So keep repeating it's the berries,
The strongest oak must fall,
The sweet things in life, to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you've never owned?
Life is just a bowl of cherries,
So live and laugh at it all.

Life is just a bowl of cherries.
Don't take it serious; it's too mysterious.
At eight each morning I have got a date,
To take my plunge 'round the Empire State.
You'll admit it's not the berries,
In a building that's so tall;
There's a guy in the show, the girls love to kiss;
Get thousands a week just for crooning like this:
Life is just a bowl of. .. Aw, nuts!
So live and laugh at it all!

My guardian angel's holding out on me!

And won't be happy till I'm on his knee!
I'll be blue until he comes my way,
Hope he takes the cue when I am sayin';

Tell me please, where can he be,
The loving he who'll bring to me
The harmony I'm dreamin' of?

George Gershwin,My One And Only Lyrics,"
                    My one and only,
What am I gonna do if you turn me down
When I'm so crazy over you

I'd be so lonely
Where am I gonna go if you turn me down
Why blacken all my skies of blue

I tell you I'm not asking any miracle
It can be done, it can be done
I know a clergyman who will roll lyrical
And make us one, and make us one

So my one and only
There isn't a reason why you should turn me down
When I'm so crazy over you

To show affection in your direction
You know I'm fit and able
I more then merely love you sincerely
My cards are on the table

Say there must be lots of other men you hypnotise
All of a sudden I've begun to realise
As follows

My one and only
If you turn me down
When I'm so crazy over you
I'd be so lonely
If you turn me down
Why blacken all my skies of blue

I tell you I'm not asking any miracle

I know a clergyman who will roll lyrical

George Gershwin,Nice Work If You Can Get It Lyrics,"
                    The man who only live for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny;
Likewise the man who works for fame --
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is
The only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant.
Fall in love -- you won't regret it.
That's the best work of all -- if you can get it.
Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky...
Oh that is nice work if you can get it.
And you can get it -- if you try.
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh...
Oh nice work if you can get it.
And you can get it -- if you try.
Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door.
Where two hearts become one...
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you,
And then taking that vow...
Nice work if you can get it,
And if you get it --
Won't you tell me how?
And you can get it -- if you try.
And you can get it -- if you try.
And you can get it -- if you try.
And you can get it -- if you try
Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky...
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it -- if you try.
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh...
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it -- if you try

All dressed up, no place to go,
Each ev'ning I'm awfully blue
I know I'm a winsome miss / I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this,
I could blossom out I know,
With somebody just like you. So...

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
I am so awf'ly misunderstood

Oh, please have some pity

Harold Arlen,Out Of This World Lyrics,"

When I'm looking at you
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew

You're right out of a book
The fairy tale I read when I was five
No armored knight out of a book
Was more enchanted by a loralei
Then I

After waiting so long
For the right time
After reaching so long for a star
All at once from long and lonely night time
And despite time, here you are

I cry, ""out of this world""
If you said we were through
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two

Harold Arlen,Over The Rainbow Lyrics,"

Way up high
There's a place that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Some day I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh why can't i?

Beyond the rainbow why

No two hearts ever beat quite the same

Harold Arlen,Smoke Rings Lyrics,"

What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?

Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow

Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue

Gloom and misery everywhere

So weary all of the time

The blues walked in and then they met me
If she stays away
That old rocking chair's bound to get me

The lord above will let me
Just walk in that sun again

While I start reviewing
The attitude of doing right

Bring gloom down to the minimum

What did they do, just when everything looked so dark?

Harold Arlen,The Man That Got Away Lyrics,"
                    The night is bitter,
The stars have lost their glitter,
The winds grow colder,
And suddenly you're older
And all because of
The man that got away.

No more his eager call,
The writing's on the wall,
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.
The man that won you
Has run off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen it's final inning,
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game.

No more that all-time thrill
For you've been through the mill,
And never a new love will
Be the same.

Good riddance, good-bye.
Every trick of his you're on to -
But fools will be fools and where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher,
It's lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up,
Tomorrow he may turn up.
There's just no letup
The livelong night and day.

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman
Looking for the man that got away . . .

                    When the sun comes out
And that rain stops beatin' on my window pane
When the sun comes out
There'll be bluebirds 'round my door, singin' like they did before

That ol' storm broke out
And my man/gal walked off and left me in the rain
Though he's/she's gone I doubt
If he'll/she'll stay away for good,I'd stop livin' if he/she should

Love is funny, it's not always peaches, cream and honey
Just when everything looked bright and sunny
Suddenly the cyclone came, I'll never be the same

Til that sun comes out
And the rain stops beatin' on my window pane
If my heart holds out
Let it rain and let it pour, it may not be long before
There's a knockin' at my door
Then you'll know the one I love walked in

Harold Arlen,You're A Builder Upper Lyrics,"

That old black magic that you weave so well
Icy fingers up
And down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

The same old tingle that I feel
Inside
When that elevator starts it's ride
Down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf that's
Caught in the tide

I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with
Such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You are the lover that I've waited for

The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Baby down and down I go,
All around I go
In a spin, loving the spin that I'm in

We're drinking my friend, to the end
Of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
I know the routine, put another nickel
In the machine
I feel kind of bad, can't you make the music
Easy and sad
I could tell you a lot, but it's not
In a gentleman's code
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
You'd never know it, but buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things I'd like to say
And if I'm gloomy, please listen to me
Till it's talked away
Well that's how it goes, and joe I know your gettin'
Anxious to close
Thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind

Harold Arlen,Stormy Weather Lyrics,"
                    Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all of the time

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all of the time

I walk around,
Heavy-hearted and sad
Night comes around
And I'm still feeling bad
Rain pourin' down
Blinding every hope I had
This pitter 'n patter 'n beatin' 'n spatterin' drivin' me mad

Love, love, love, love
This misery will be the end of me

[Bridge:]

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Harold Arlen,Let's Take A Walk Around The Block Lyrics,"
                    I never traveled further north than old van courtland park
And never further south than the aquarium
I've seen the charm of jersey city, but first let me remark
I saw it from the empire state solarium

But we've been putting nickels in the postal savings bank
And when those nickels pile up, we can toddle off in swank
And I don't mean an ordinary cook's tour
I mean a cabin de-luxe tour

Someday we'll go places
New lands and new faces
The day we quit punching the clock
The future looks pleasant,
But at present
Let's take a walk around the block.

You're just the companion
I want at grand canyon
For throwing old blades down the rock
The money we have'll go for travel
Meantime, let's walk around the block.

Gangway, we'll begin
When our, ship comes in
I'll sit on your lap
All over the map

To london in may time
To venice in play time
To paris in time for a frock
To boston in bean time
Darling, meantime
Let's take a walk around the block.

[Bridge:]

In winter at christmas,
We'll visit the isthmus
And see how they lock up a lock
And then in caracas, on a jackass,
We'll take a ride around the block.

We'll keep to our promise,
To visit st. Thomas
And then at jamaica we'll dock
The prospect is thrilling,
Still I am willing,
Just now to talk around the block.

Onward, to cathay
Then to mandalay
Boom on to bangkok
P'r'aps vladivostok

We'll send the folks cables
Accumulate labels
Buy souvenirs till we're in hock
But since we are flat in old manhattan

Harold Arlen,As Long As I Live Lyrics,"
                    Maybe I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Life isn't long enough baby, but I can love you as long as I live.

Maybe I can't give you diamonds and things like I want to,
But I can promise you, baby, I'm gonna want to as long as I live.

I never cared, but now I'm scared, I won't live long enough.
That's why I wear my rubbers when it rains and eat an apple every day then see
The doctor anyway.

What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.



I'll even wear long underwear, when winter breezes blow
I'm gonna take good care of me because, a sneeze or two might mean the flu,
And that would never never do

What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.

And he's right

It was just one of those things
But don't you ever bet me

We'll be happy together, unhappy together
Now won't that be just fine
The days may be cloudy or sunny

Harold Arlen,My Shining Hour Lyrics,"
                    Y shining hour


This moment, this minute
And each second in it
Will leave a glow upon the sky
And as time goes by, it will never die

This will be my shining hour
Calm and happy and bright
In my dreams, your face will flower
Through the darkness of the night

Like the lights of home before me
Or an angel, watching o'er me
This will be my shining hour
'til I'm with you again

Harold Arlen,Don't Like Goodbyes Lyrics,"
                    Don't like good-byes, tears or sighs.
I'm not too good at leavin' time.
I got no taste for grievin' time. No, no - not me.

You've been my near ones, always my dear ones.
I never thought that I would find
Another love, a different kind, but it came to be.

Well, if you think I'm tellin' you lies,
Go try your luck and look into her eyes.
But remember, you must remember she's mine,
And my world over head has a clear new shine.

Don't want to leave you, sorry to grieve you.
It's travelin' time and I must move on.
Found the girl to lean upon.
And if I could arrange it,
Oh would I care to change it? Not me!

(musical interlude)

Don't wanna leave you, sorry to grieve you.

Down with love the flowers and rice and shoes
Down with love the root of all midnight blues
Down with things that give you that well-known pain
Take that moon wrap it in cellophane

Down with love let's liquidate all it's friends
Moon and June and roses and rainbow's ends
Down with songs that moan about night and day
Down with love yes take it away, away

Away
Far away
Give it back to the birds and bees and the Viennese

Down with eyes romantic and stupid
Down with sighs and down with cupid
Brother let's stuff that dove
Down with love

The moons the Junes the roses and rainbow's ends
Down with songs that moan about night and day
Down with love yes take it away, away

Since the world began, woman was made for man
Where is she, where is the woman for me?

For every prince there's a princess
For every joe there's a joan
And if you wait, you will find the mate
Born for you alone, happy to be your own
Where is she, where is the woman for me?

Find the one, find the one
Then together you will find the sun

For every heart there's a moment
For every hand, a glove
And for every woman, a man to love

Harold Arlen,Hooray For Love Lyrics,"

Here's to my first romance - ages ago
Here's to the boys I've kissed, and to complete the list
Here's to the boys who said ""no!""

Love, love, hooray for love
Who was ever too blase for love
Make this the night for love
If we have to fight, let's fight for love

Some sigh and cry for love
Ah, but in pa-ree they die for love
Some waste away for love
Just the same - hooray for love!



It's the rocket to the moon, with a touch of ""clare de lune""
It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...

Some trust to fate for love,
Others have to take off weight for love
Some go berzerk for love
Loafers even go to work for love

Sad songs are sobbed for love
People have their noses bobbed for love
Some say we pay for love

Harold Arlen,It's Only A Paper Moon Lyrics,"
                    Music by harold arlen.
Lyrics by E. Y. (yip) harburg

I never feel a thing is real
When I'm away from you
Out of your embrace
The world's a temporary parking place

Mmm, mm, mm, mm
A bubble for a minute
Mmm, mm, mm, mm
You smile, the bubble has a rainbow in it

Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a barnum and bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/harold+arlen/ + /h/harold+arlen/its+only+a+paper+moon_20064353.html,1,0,music by harold arlen lyrics by e y yip harburg i never feel a thing is real when i'm away from you out of your embrace the world's a temporary parking place mmm mm mm mm a bubble for a minute mmm mm mm mm you smile the bubble has a rainbow in it say it's only a paper moon sailing over a cardboard sea but it wouldn't be make-believe if you believed in me yes it's only a canvas sky hanging over a muslin tree but it wouldn't be make-believe if you believed in me without your love it's a honky-tonk parade without your love it's a melody played in a penny arcade it's a barnum and bailey world just as phony as it can be but it wouldn't be make-believe if you believed in me,music by harold arlen lyrics by e y yip harburg i never feel a thing is real when i m away from you out of your embrace the world s a temporary parking place mmm mm mm mm a bubble for a minute mmm mm mm mm you smile the bubble has a rainbow in it say it s only a paper moon sailing over a cardboard sea but it wouldn t be make believe if you believed in me yes it s only a canvas sky hanging over a muslin tree but it wouldn t be make believe if you believed in me without your love it s a honky tonk parade without your love it s a melody played in a penny arcade it s a barnum and bailey world just as phony as it can be but it wouldn t be make believe if you believed in me
Harold Arlen,Kickin' The Gong Around Lyrics,"
                    It was down in chinatown,
All the cokies laid around,
Some were high and some were mighty low;
There were millions on the floor
When a knock came on the door,
And there stood old smoky joe.

He was sweatin', cold and pale,
He was lookin' for his frail,
He was broke and all his junk ran out;
Nobody made a sound,
As he stood and looked around,
And then you hear old smoky shout:

Saying, ""tell me where is minnie?
My poor minnie!
Has she been here,
Kicking the gong around? ""

""if you don't know minnie,
She's tall and skinny,
She gets her pleasure
Kicking the gong around!""

[scat chorus]

""just tell her smoky joe
Was here and had to go.""
And as he departed,
The curtains parted,
And there stood minnie
Kicking the gong around!

Harold Arlen,Last Night When We Were Young Lyrics,"
                    Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

Harold Arlen,Let's Fall In Love Lyrics,"
                    We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be, let our hearts discover
I have a feeling, it's a feeling I'm concealing - I don't know why
It's just a mental, incidental, sentimental - alibi
But I adore you, so strong for you
Why go on stalling, I am falling, love is calling - why be shy
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love
Our hearts are made of it, let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it
Let's close our eyes
And make our own paradise
Little we know of it, still we can try
To make a go of it
We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be, let our hearts discover

Hercules,Go The Distance [Michael Bolton] Lyrics,"
                    I have often dreamed
Of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome
Would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer
When they see my face
And a voice keeps saying
This is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday
I can go the distance
I will find my way
If I can be strong
I know ev'ry mile
Will be worth my while
When I go the distance
I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road
To embrace my fate
Though that road may wander
It will lead me to you
And a thousand years
Would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime
But somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back
I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track
No, I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't lose hope
'Till I go the distance
And my journey is complete

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart

Like a shooting star
I will go the distance
I will search the world
I will face it's harms
I don't care how far
I can go the distance
'Till I find my hero's welcome
Waiting in your arms

I will search the world
I will face it's harms

Hercules,Zero To Hero Lyrics,"
                    Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking sro
He was a no one
A zero, zero
Now he's a honcho
He's a hero
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero just like that (snaps)

When he smiled
The girls went wild with
Oohs and aahs
And they slapped his face
On ev'ry vase
(On ev'ry ""vahse"")

From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian urn?

Say amen
There he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up
Just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs

Hercie, he comes
He sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were
Going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains, and spunk
From zero to hero a major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk

Who put the glad in gladiator?
Hercules!
Whose daring deeds are great theater?
Hercules
Isn't he bold?
No one braver
Is he sweet
Our fav'rite flavor
Hercules, Hercules...

Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high
And the nicest guy
Not conceited

He was a nothin'
A zero, zero
Now he's a honcho
He's a hero

He hit the heights at breakneck speed
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero

Hercules,One Last Hope Lyrics,"
                    So, ya wanna be a hero, kid?
Well, whoop-de-do!
I have been around the block before
With blockeads just like you

Each and ev'ryone a disappointment
Pain for which there ain't no ointment
So much for excuses
Though a kid of Zeus' is
Asking me to jump into the fray
My answer is two words--
O. K.
You win
Oh gods
Oy vay!

I'd gives up hope that someone would come along
A fellow who'd ring the bell for once--
Not the gong
The kind who wins trophies
Won't settle for low fees
At least semi pro fees, but no--
I get the greenhorn

I've been out to pasture pal, my ambition gone
Content to spend lazy days and to graze my lawn
But you need an advisor
A satyr, but wiser
A good merchandiser, and oohh!
There goes my ulcer!

I'm down to one last hope
And I hope it's you
Though, kid, you're not exactly a dream come true
I've trained enough turkeys
Who never came through
You're my one last hope so you'll have to do

Demigods have faced the odds
And ended up a mockery
Don't believe the stories
That you read on all the crockery

To be a true hero, kid, is a dying art
Like painting a masterpiece
It's a work of heart
It takes more than sinew
Comes down to what's in you
You have to continue to grow
Now that's more like it!

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Way out on the rim of the hill

Hoagy Carmichael,"In The Cool, Cool, Cool Of The Evening Lyrics","
                    Sue wants a barbecue,
Sam wants to boil a ham,
Grace votes for Bouillabaisse stew.
Jake wants a weeny bake,
Steak and a layer cake,
He'll get a tummy ache too.
We'll rent a tent or tepee.
Let the town crier cry.
And if it's RSVP
This is what I'll reply

In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Tell 'em I'll be there
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Better save a chair
When the party's gettin' a glow on
And singin' fills the air
In the shank of the night
When the doin's are right
You can tell 'em I'll be there

""Whee"" said the bumblebee,""
""Let's have a jubilee""
""When?"" said the prairie hen, ""Soon?""
""Shore"" said the dinosaur.
""Where?"" said the grizzly bear,
""Under the light of the moon?""
""How `bout ya, brother jackass?""
Ev'ryone gaily cried,
""You comin' to the fracas?""
Over his specs he sighed

In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Tell 'em I'll be there
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Slickum on my hair.
When the party's gettin' a glow on
And singin' fills the air

Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal

But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I didn't realize I was wise, what love could do;
Now I'm facing a future that hasn't that one happy ending,
And I'm a fool, I guess, to confess it all to you.

I never knew I could love anybody
Honey like I'm lovin' you.
I didn't realize
What a pair of eyes
And a baby smile could do.

I can't sleep, I can't eat,
I never knew a single soul could be so sweet,
For I never knew I could love anybody
Honey like I'm lovin' you.

Hoagy Carmichael,Huggin' And Chalkin' Lyrics,"
                    I gotta gal that's mighty sweet
With blue eyes and tiny feet
Her name is Rosabelle Magee
And she tips the scale at three o three

Oh gee, but ain't it grand to have a girl
So big and fat that when you hug her
You don't know where you're at
You have to take a piece of chalk in your hand
And hug a way and chalk a mark
To see where you began

One day when I was a huggin' and a chalkin'
And a chalkin' and a huggin' a way
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' around the other way 'round the mountain
Comin' around the other way

Nobody ever said I'm weak
My bones don't ache and my joints creak
But I, I grow absolutely limp
Every time I kiss my baby blimp, oh

One day I had a yen for some one leaner, she was meaner than a
Mink in a pen. So I left her now I'm happy as a fella could be
Huggin' and chalkin' in once a gain 'round my Rosie
Huggin' and chalkin' in once again

One day I was a huggin' and a chalkin' and a beggin' her to be my bride
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' a round the other side of the mountain
Comin' around the other side

Hoagy Carmichael,Hong Kong Blues Lyrics,"
                    It's the story of a very unfortunate colored man
Who got arrested down in old Hong Kong
He got twenty years privilege taken away from him
When he kicked old Buddha's gong

And now he's poppin' the piano just to raise the price
Of a ticket to the land of the free
Well, he says his home's in Frisco where they send the rice
But it's really in Tennessee

That's why he said, ""I need someone to love me
I need somebody to carry me home to San Francisco
And bury my body there
I need someone to lend me a fifty dollar bill and then
I'll leave Hong Kong behind me for happiness once again""

Won't somebody believe
I've a yen to see that Bay again
Every time I try to leave
Sweet opium won't let me fly away

I need someone to love me
I need somebody to carry me home to San Francisco
And bury my body there

You needn’t act so mighty righteous with that innocent mug

Oh! Boy but how she could love
Bessie had affection that was simply wonderful,terrible
But Bessie couldn't help it any more than you could or I could.

Why, oh! Why did she yell with delight
'Cause Bessie couldn't help it any more than you could, or I could

Hoagy Carmichael,Lazy River Lyrics,"
                    Up a lazy river by the old mill run
Lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger awhile in the shade of the tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me

You know, before your sister was born
This is what your Mama did for a living
Music opened a whole new world to me
No matter how bad I feel, no matter how sad or sick I am
I just touched these keys and poof, like magic
I always seemed to feel better
I've always known you had talent, Bobbie
This piano is for you, Charlie worked hard for it
See God wouldn't have made you suffer so much
If you weren't gonna make up for it later

How happy you can be
Up a lazy river with me

Throw away your troubles, baby
Dream a dream with me

Up a lazy river with me

From the halfway mark

To be a star, a big star
You gotta be talented obviously
You gotta be tenacious, have charisma
But most importantly, you've gotta have it
A great intangible and you've got it all, Bobbie
You're gonna be bigger than Sinatra
I'd settle for a little Jolson Mama, Mama, Mama

Ah ah ah, there are blue skies up above
Forever long as we're in love
We'll be up a lazy river
Up a crazy lazy river
Up a lazy river
I ain't goin' your way
Get out of my way
Up a lazy river with me

That one wonderful day when we met, dear
The world over was blue clover
And hearts carefree and gay

Tonight darling, I pray to recapture
Just one hour, just one flower
From love's faded bouquet

Kisses that came with the flame of springtime
Burning your name in my heart
Precious to me like a rosary
Now that we're apart

One morning in May to remember
The love smolders away to an ember
And dreams perish, we'll still cherish

Hoagy Carmichael,Stardust Lyrics,"
                    Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
Ah but that was long ago
Now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Beside the garden wall when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew

Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Hoagy Carmichael,The Golden Rocket Lyrics,"
                    Board!
From old Montana down to Alabam' 
I've been before and I'll travel again
You trifling women can't keep a good man down
You've dealt the cards but you missed the play
So hit the road and be on your way
Gonna board the Golden Rocket and leave this town

I was a good engine a-runnin on time
But baby I'm switchin' to another line
So honey, never hang your single out for me
I'm tired of running on the same old track
Bought a one way ticket and I won't be back
This Golden Rocket is gonna roll my blues away

Hear that lonesome whistle blow
That's your cue and by now you know
That I've got another true love waitin' in Tennessee
This midnight special is burning the rails
So woman don't try to follow my trail
This Golden Rocket is gonna roll my blues away

Hear her thunder on through the night
This Golden Rocket is a-doin' me right
That sunny old southland sure is a part of me
Now from your call-board erase my name
Your fire done went out you done lost your flame
And this Golden Rocket is a-rollin' my blues away

That old conductor he seemed to know 
You've done me wrong I was feeling low 
For he yelled aloud we're over that Dixon Line
The Brakeman started singin' a song 
Said 'You're worried now, but it won't be long'
'This Golden Rocket is leavin' your blues behind'

Then the Porter yelled with his southern drawl, 
'Let's rise and shine.  Good mornin' you all'
And I sprang to my feet to greet the newborn day
When I kissed my baby in the station door
That whistle blew like it never before

Hoagy Carmichael,The Lamplighter's Serenade Lyrics,"
                    A moment after dark around the park
An old-fashion gent comes parading
Dressed in funny clothes but singing as he goes
The Lamplighter's Serenade

The old boy loves to talk with couples on the walk
But when it's half after love time
He reaches for his sticks and from his bag of tricks
He lights every star in the sky

And if a lady or a beau should answer no
He sprinkles their hearts with his magic
Then he steals away to sing another day
The Lamplighter's Serenade

The old boy loves to talk with the couples on the walk
But when it's half after love time
He reaches for his sticks and from his bag of tricks
He lights every star in the sky

And if a lady or a beau should answer no

Hoagy Carmichael,The Old Music Master Lyrics,"
                    One night long ago by the light of the moon,
An old music master sat composing a tune,
His spirit was soaring and his heart full of joy,
When right out of nowhere stepped a little colored boy.
You gotta jump it, music master,
You gotta play that rhythm faster,
You're never gonna get it played
On the Happy Cat Hit Parade.
You better tell your friend Beethoven,
And Mister Reginald De Koven
They better do the same as you,
Or they're gonna be corny too.
Long about nineteen seventeen
Jazz'll come upon the scene,
Then about nineteen thirty-five
You'll begin to hear swing,
Boogie Woogie and Jive,
You gotta show that big broadcaster
That you're a solid music master,
And you'll achieve posterity,
That's a bit of advice from me.
The old music master simply sat there amazed,
As wide-eyed and open-mouthed he gazed and he gazed
How can you be certain little boy, tell me how?
Because I was born, my friend,
A hundred years from now.
He hit a chord that rocked the spinet
And disappeared into the infinite,
And up until the present day,
You can take it from me,
He's as right as can be,
Ev'rything has happened that-a-way.

Out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning
Look how late it gets

Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight

Here we are
In the cozy chair
Pickin' on a wishbone
From the frigid air

Two sleepy people with nothing to say
And too much in love to break away

Do you remember
The nights we used to linger in the hall?
Your father didn't like me at all

Do you remember
The reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest

Well, here we are
Just about the same
Foggy little fella
Drowsy little dame

Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight

Waiting on the weary shore
I'm just a man who's only human

Without a warning I found she was gone
How could she do it, why should she do it
She never done it before

Am I blue, am I blue
Ain't these tears in these eyes telling you
How can you ask me am I blue
Why, wouldn't you be too
If each plan with your woman
Done fell through

There was a time
When I was her only one
But now I'm the sad and lonely one, lonely

Irving Berlin,Doin' What Comes Natur'lly Lyrics,"
                    Annie oakley and female chorus:
Folks are dumb where I come from,
They ain't had any learning.
Still they're happy as can be
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally).
Folks like us could never fuss
With schools and books and learning.
Still we've gone from A to Z,
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally)
You don't have to know how to read or write
When you're out with a feller in the pale moonlight.
You don't have to look in a book to find out
What he thinks of the moon and what is on his mind.
That comes naturally (that comes naturally).
My uncle out in Texas can't even write his name.
He signs his checks with ""x's""
But they cash them just the same.
If you saw my pa and ma,
You'd know they had no learning,
Still they've raised a family
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally)
Cousin Jack has never read an almanac on drinking
Still he's always on the spree
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally).
Sister Sal who's musical has never had a lesson,
Still she's learned to sing off-key
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally).
You don't have to go a private school
Not to pick up a penny near a stubborn mule,
You don't have to have a professor's dome
Not to go for the honey when the bee's not home.
That comes naturally (that comes naturally).
My tiny baby brother, who's never read a book,
Knows one s** from the other,
All he had to do was look,
Grandpa Bill is on the hill
With someone he just married.
There he is at ninety-three,
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/doin+what+comes+naturlly_20186161.html,1,0,annie oakley and female chorus folks are dumb where i come from they ain't had any learning still they're happy as can be doin' what comes naturally doin' what comes naturally folks like us could never fuss with schools and books and learning still we've gone from a to z doin' what comes naturally doin' what comes naturally you don't have to know how to read or write when you're out with a feller in the pale moonlight you don't have to look in a book to find out what he thinks of the moon and what is on his mind that comes naturally that comes naturally my uncle out in texas can't even write his name he signs his checks with x's but they cash them just the same if you saw my pa and ma you'd know they had no learning still they've raised a family doin' what comes naturally doin' what comes naturally cousin jack has never read an almanac on drinking still he's always on the spree doin' what comes naturally doin' what comes naturally sister sal who's musical has never had a lesson still she's learned to sing off-key doin' what comes naturally doin' what comes naturally you don't have to go a private school not to pick up a penny near a stubborn mule you don't have to have a professor's dome not to go for the honey when the bee's not home that comes naturally that comes naturally my tiny baby brother who's never read a book knows one s from the other all he had to do was look grandpa bill is on the hill with someone he just married there he is at ninety-three doin' what comes naturally doin' what comes naturally,annie oakley and female chorus folks are dumb where i come from they ain t had any learning still they re happy as can be doin what comes naturally doin what comes naturally folks like us could never fuss with schools and books and learning still we ve gone from a to z doin what comes naturally doin what comes naturally you don t have to know how to read or write when you re out with a feller in the pale moonlight you don t have to look in a book to find out what he thinks of the moon and what is on his mind that comes naturally that comes naturally my uncle out in texas can t even write his name he signs his checks with x s but they cash them just the same if you saw my pa and ma you d know they had no learning still they ve raised a family doin what comes naturally doin what comes naturally cousin jack has never read an almanac on drinking still he s always on the spree doin what comes naturally doin what comes naturally sister sal who s musical has never had a lesson still she s learned to sing off key doin what comes naturally doin what comes naturally you don t have to go a private school not to pick up a penny near a stubborn mule you don t have to have a professor s dome not to go for the honey when the bee s not home that comes naturally that comes naturally my tiny baby brother who s never read a book knows one s from the other all he had to do was look grandpa bill is on the hill with someone he just married there he is at ninety three doin what comes naturally doin what comes naturally

I can't believe that it's happened,
And still it's true.

I got lost in his arms, and I had to stay.
It was dark in his arms, and I lost my way.
From the dark came a voice, and it seemed to say,
""there you go, there you go.""

How I felt, as I fell, I just can't recall.
But his arms held me fast and it broke the fall.
And I said to my heart as it foolishly
Kepte jumping all around.

I know where to find the boys
I don't go through a club or two
I just find you and there are the boys
To get you alone I strive
You ask me to tea at five
I find you then with other men
And wonder when my chance will arrive

How's chances, say, how are the chances
Of making you love me the way I love you

How many young men must I fight with
To be in right with
In right with you

How's chances for one of those glances
A glimpse of the heaven I'm longing to see

How's chances to end all your romances
And start taking your chances with me

Too soon, you vanished out of my dreams,
Too late, to start all over it seems...

And soon somebody else will make a fuss about you
But how about me?

It's over, all over
And soon somebody else will tell his friends about you
But how about me?

You'll find somebody new
But what am I to do?
I'll still remember you
When you have forgotten

And maybe, a baby
Will climb upon your knee and put it's arms about you
But how about me?

Moonlight, was beaming down from the sky,
Lovelight, was gleaming deep in your eye,
Sunlight, for just a moment and then,
Twilight, and I was lonely again,

It's over, all over
And soon somebody else will tell his friends about you
But how about me?

You'll find somebody new
But what am I to do?

Who pleases ev'ry woman, man and child?

Who's got the show that gets the most applause?
Five hundred Indians and fifty squaws
Ten feature acts and there's the special feature still

Or a marksman shoot an earring from an ear?
-No, we haven't
Did you ever see a hold up?
-No, sir
Then gather closer
And let me give you some of the atmosphere

The hour is midnight and all is still
We see the stagecoach climbing up a hill
Going along a mountain trail carrying passengers and mail
Never suspecting danger as they roll along
The watchful driver is in his seat
His trusty rifle lying at his feet
Some of the passengers inside seem to be dozing as they ride
Never suspecting there is something really wrong

Suddenly there's a shout
-What is it all about?
What is it all about you ask? It's Indians
-Indians!
Indians
-Indians!
Very notable, cut your throat-able Indians
-Indians!

Just when they've taken ev'ryone by force
Who makes an entrance on a big white horse?
Who starts a' shootin' till there's no one left to kill

Irving Berlin,Harlem On My Mind Lyrics,"
                    Em'ralds in my bracelets and diamonds in my rings
A Riviera chateau and a lot of other things
And I'm blue, so blue am I
Lots of ready money in seven diff'rent banks
I counted up this morning, it's about a million francs
And I'm blue, so blue, and I know why

I've got Harlem on my mind
I've a longing to be lowdown
And my ""parlez-vous"" will not ring true
With Harlem on my mind

I've been wined and I've been dined
But I'm heading for a showdown
'Cause I can't go on from night to dawn
With Harlem on my mind

I go to supper with a French Marquis
Each evening after the show
My lips begin to whisper ""Mon Cheri""
But my heart keeps singing ""Hi-de-ho""

I've become too darn refined
And at night I hate to go down
To the high-falutin' flat that Lady Mendel designed
With Harlem on my mind

Em'ralds in my bracelets, diamonds in my rings
A Riviera chateau and a lot of other things
And I'm blue, so blue am I
Lots of ready money in seven diff'rent banks

I counted up this morning, it was 'bout a million francs
And I'm blue, so blue, and I know why

I've got Harlem on my mind
And I'm longin' to be lowdown
And my ""parlez-vous"" will not ring true
With Harlem on my mind

I've been dined and I've been wined
But I'm headin' for a showdown
'Cause I can't go on from night to dawn
With Harlem on my mind

I go to supper with a French Marquis
Each evening after the show
My lips begin to whisper ""Mon Cheri""
But my heart keeps singin' ""Hi-de-ho""

I've become too damned refined
And at night I hate to go down
To that high-falutin' flat that Lady Mendel designed
With Harlem on my mind

I've got Harlem on my mind
And I'm longing to be lowdown
And my ""parlez-vous"" will not ring true
With Harlem on my mind

I've been dined and I've been wined
But sure as your born I'm headin' for a showdown
'Cause I can't go on from night to dawn
With Harlem on my mind

And when I'm bathing in my marble tub
Each evening after the show
I get to thinkin' 'bout that Cotton Club
And my heart starts chirping ""Hi-de-ho""

Help me!
I've been too damned refined
And at night I hate to go down
To that flat with fifty million Frenchmen taggin' behind

Irving Berlin,Finale Lyrics,"
                    Frank butler:
The cowboys, the wrestlers, the tumblers, the clowns
The roustabouts that move the show at dawn

Annie oakley:
The music, the spotlights, the people, the towns
Your baggage with the labels pasted on

Frank butler:
The sawdust and the horses and the smell

Annie oakley:
The towel you've taken from the last hotel

Annie oakley, frank butler and chorus:
There's no business like show business
Like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
Everything the traffic will allow
No where could you have that happy feeling
When you aren't stealing that extra bow

There's no people like show people
They smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold
You may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack o' gold
Let's go on with the show
Let's go on with the show!

Annie oakley and frank butler:
They say that falling in love is wonderful
It's wonderful, so they say.
And with a moon up above it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me.

Annie oakley:
I can't recall who said it

Frank butler:
I know I never read it
I only know that falling in love is grand

And to hold a girl in your arms
Is wonderful,

Wonderful...

Snap their fingers

Irving Berlin,Everybody Step Lyrics,"
                    Soon you'll hear a tune
That's gonna lift you out of your seat
It could be sweeter but then the meter
Was written especially for your feet
Fly away up high
Upon a syncopated balloon
A little ginger will never injure
Hear them tuning up, they'll be playing soon

[Chorus]
Everybody step to the syncopated rhythm
Let's be goin' with 'em when they begin
You'll be sayin' Yes Sir the band is grand
He's the best professor in all the land
Listen to the pep that emerges from the middle
Of the jazzy fiddle under his chin
Oh, what music
The clarineter could not be better
Hear that strain
I don't know just what it is but it's great
They simply ruin it
Look at 'em doin' it
Come, come don't hesitate
Everybody step if you want to see a glutton
When it comes to struttin' over the ground
Wait'll you see my little sweetie and me
Step, step, stepping around
In A Cozy Kitchenette Apartment

I'm getting tired of eating in restaurants
They don't appeal to me
If we could own a cute apartment

Three little rooms will be just like heaven
When we are married dear
In a

While you're cooking a stew

Irving Berlin,I Love A Piano Lyrics,"
                    [1st verse:]
As a child I went wild when a band played
How I ran to the man when his hand swayed
Clarinets were my pets, and a slide trombone I thought was simply
Divine
But today when they play I could hiss them
Ev'ry bar is a jar to my system
But there's one musical instrument that I call mine

[chorus:]
I love a piano, I love a piano
I love to hear somebody play
Upon a piano, a grand piano
It simply carries me away

I know a fine way to treat a steinway
I love to run my fingers o'er the keys, the ivories

And with the pedal I love to meddle
When padarewski comes this way
I'm so delighted if I'm invited
To hear that long haired genius play

So you can keep your fiddle and your bow
Give me a p-i-a-n-o, oh, oh
I love to stop right beside an upright
Or a high toned baby grand

[2nd verse:]
When a green tetrazine starts to warble
I grow cold as an old piece of marble
I allude to the crude little party singer who don't know when to pause
At her best I detest the soprano
But I run to the one at the piano
I always love the accomp'niment and that's because                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/i+love+a+piano_20068103.html,1,0,st verse as a child i went wild when a band played how i ran to the man when his hand swayed clarinets were my pets and a slide trombone i thought was simply divine but today when they play i could hiss them ev'ry bar is a jar to my system but there's one musical instrument that i call mine chorus i love a piano i love a piano i love to hear somebody play upon a piano a grand piano it simply carries me away i know a fine way to treat a steinway i love to run my fingers o'er the keys the ivories and with the pedal i love to meddle when padarewski comes this way i'm so delighted if i'm invited to hear that long haired genius play so you can keep your fiddle and your bow give me a p-i-a-n-o oh oh i love to stop right beside an upright or a high toned baby grand nd verse when a green tetrazine starts to warble i grow cold as an old piece of marble i allude to the crude little party singer who don't know when to pause at her best i detest the soprano but i run to the one at the piano i always love the accomp'niment and that's because,st verse as a child i went wild when a band played how i ran to the man when his hand swayed clarinets were my pets and a slide trombone i thought was simply divine but today when they play i could hiss them ev ry bar is a jar to my system but there s one musical instrument that i call mine chorus i love a piano i love a piano i love to hear somebody play upon a piano a grand piano it simply carries me away i know a fine way to treat a steinway i love to run my fingers o er the keys the ivories and with the pedal i love to meddle when padarewski comes this way i m so delighted if i m invited to hear that long haired genius play so you can keep your fiddle and your bow give me a p i a n o oh oh i love to stop right beside an upright or a high toned baby grand nd verse when a green tetrazine starts to warble i grow cold as an old piece of marble i allude to the crude little party singer who don t know when to pause at her best i detest the soprano but i run to the one at the piano i always love the accomp niment and that s because

To the oceans white with foam,

What is mine, dear, will be yours
When the sun shines and when it pours
Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
Fifty-fifty in ev'rything
Haven't got much, even that much to my name
Fortune's door shut, can't get in, but just the same

My ear for music, my feet for dancing, my lips for kissing
I'll share it all with you

My sense of humor, my disposition, my rosy future
I'll share it all with you

Someday, honey, I'll have money
You know what that brings
Furs and diamond rings
And besides those things
There'll be

My ear for music, my feet for dancing, my lips for kissing
I'll share it all with you

[WINNIE:]
My head for thinking, my face for smiling, my hands for cooking
I'll share it all with you

My understanding, my loving nature, my good intentions
I'll share it all with you

I'm not twenty but there's plenty
Underneath my hat
I know where I'm at
And on top of that

Irving Berlin,Let's Take An Old Fashioned Walk Lyrics,"
                    Let's take an old fashioned walk, I'm just bursting with talk.
What a tale could be told if we went for an old fashioned walk.
Let's take a stroll through the park, down a lane where it's dark
And a heart that's controlled, may relax on an old fashioned walk.
I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart,
There's nothing like walking and having a ""heart to heart.""
I know a girl who declined, couldn't make up her mind.
She was wrapped up and sold, coming home from an old fashioned walk.

Irving Berlin,Let's Face The Music And Dance Lyrics,"
                    There may be trouble ahead
But while there's music and moonlight (moonlight and music) and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance

Before the fiddlers have fled
Before they ask us to pay the bill, and while we still have the chance
Let's face the music and dance

Soon, we'll be without the moon
Humming a different tune - and then...

There may be teardrops to shed
So (But) while there's music and moonlight (moonlight and music) and love and romance

You'll forget your trouble
If you go into your dance
You'll forget your woe

Come
Get together
Let the dance floor feel your leather
Step as lightly as a feather
Let yourself go

Come
Hit the timber
Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba?
Let yourself go

Let yourself go
Relax
And let yourself go
Relax
You've got yourself tied up in a knot
The night is cold but the music's hot

Come
Cuddle closer

Irving Berlin,Lazy Lyrics,"
                    [1st verse:]
Ev'ry time
I see a puppy upon a summer's day
A puppy dog at play
My heart is filled with envy
That's because
My heart is yearning to pass the time away
Like that pup
'cause I'm all fed up
And tho' it's wrong to be
I long to be

[chorus:]
Lazy
I want to be lazy
I want to be out in the sun
With no work to be done

Under that awning
They call the sky
Stretching and yawning
And let the world go drifting by

I want to peep
Through the deep
Tangled wildwood
Counting sheep
'til I sleep
Like a child would

With a great big valise full
Of books to read where it's peaceful
While I'm
Killing time
Being lazy

[2nd verse:]
Life is short
And getting shorter with each day that goes by
And how the time does fly
Before you know, it's over
That's why I'm
In such a hurry to pack my things and fly
To a spot
Where it's nice and hot
And hear the birdies sing

Irving Berlin,Lady Of The Evening Lyrics,"
                    After the gray of a long dreary day comes the evening
Peaceful and calm as a sheltering palm is the evening
Daytime has gone to rest, there in the golden west
Soon little stars will appear in the sky
Seeming to say, ""We are here, hush-a-bye""

Evening, lady of the evening
I can hear you calling me
Calling, while the shades are falling
Falling over land and sea

You can make the cares and troubles
That followed me through the day
Fold their tents just like the Arabs
And silently steal away

Evening, lady of the evening
I hear you calling me

After the sun when its day's work is done comes the evening
Then with the night comes the angels who light up the evening
There in the sky they stand, each with a torch in hand
Then one by one, little stars in the sky
Look down and say, ""We are here, hush-a-bye""                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/lady+of+the+evening_21299153.html,1,0,after the gray of a long dreary day comes the evening peaceful and calm as a sheltering palm is the evening daytime has gone to rest there in the golden west soon little stars will appear in the sky seeming to say we are here hush-a-bye evening lady of the evening i can hear you calling me calling while the shades are falling falling over land and sea you can make the cares and troubles that followed me through the day fold their tents just like the arabs and silently steal away evening lady of the evening i hear you calling me after the sun when its day's work is done comes the evening then with the night comes the angels who light up the evening there in the sky they stand each with a torch in hand then one by one little stars in the sky look down and say we are here hush-a-bye,after the gray of a long dreary day comes the evening peaceful and calm as a sheltering palm is the evening daytime has gone to rest there in the golden west soon little stars will appear in the sky seeming to say we are here hush a bye evening lady of the evening i can hear you calling me calling while the shades are falling falling over land and sea you can make the cares and troubles that followed me through the day fold their tents just like the arabs and silently steal away evening lady of the evening i hear you calling me after the sun when its day s work is done comes the evening then with the night comes the angels who light up the evening there in the sky they stand each with a torch in hand then one by one little stars in the sky look down and say we are here hush a bye

Is something that can be done by two
For I'd really like to stay

It's a lovely day today
And whatever you've got to do

It's a lovely day today
But you're probably busy too
So I suppose there's nothing we can do

For if you've got something that must be done
And it can only be done by one
There is nothing more to say
Except it's a lovely day for saying
It's a lovely day

It's a lovely day today
If you've something that must get done
Now don't forget two heads are better than just one

And besides I'm certain if you knew me
You'd find I'm very good company
Won't you kindly let me stay?

Irving Berlin,I'm Putting All My Eggs In One Basket Lyrics,"
                    I've been a roaming romeo
My juliets have been many
But now my roaming days have gone
Too many irons in the fire
Is worse than not having any
I've had my share and from now on:

I'm putting all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting ev'rything I've got on you

I'm giving all my love to one baby
Heaven help me if my baby don't come through

I've got a great big amount
Saved up in my love account
Honey
And I've decided
Love divided
In two
Won't do

So
I'm putting all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting everything I've got on you

[2]
I've been a roaming juliet
My romeos have been many
But now my roaming days have gone
Too many irons in the fire
Is worse than not having any

I'm putting all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting ev'rything I've got on you

I'm giving all my love to one baby
Heaven help me if my baby don't come through

I've tried to love more than one
Finding it just can't be done
Honey
There's one I lie to
When I try to
Be true
To two

I'm putting all my eggs in one basket

And I'll have totem poles, tomahawks, pipes of peace
Which will go to prove
I'm an Indian too
A Sioux
A Sioux
With my chief in his teepee
We'll raise an Indian family
And I'll be busy night and day
Looking like a flour sack
With two papooses on my back
And three papooses on the way
Like the Chippewa, Iroquois, Omaha
Like those Indians
I'm an Indian too
A Sioux
A Sioux
Just like Rising Moon, Falling Pants, Running Nose
Like those Indians
I'm an Indian too

Some Indian summer's day
Without a care
I may run away

Irving Berlin,I'm A Bad Bad Man Lyrics,"
                    Frank:]
I'm honored, I'm flattered, this greeting really mattered
This welcome is grand but I'm really concerned
I like your attention, but this I have to mention
You're playing with fire and you're apt to get burned
There's a girl in Tennessee
Who's sorry she met up with me
Can't go back to Tennessee
I'm a bad, bad man
There's a girl in Omaha
But I ran faster than her pa
Can't go back to Omaha
I'm a bad, bad man
There's a girl in Wyoming and they're combing Wyoming
To find the man in white who was out with her that night
There's a girl in Arkansas
The sheriff is her brother-in-law
Can't go back to Arkansas
I'm a bad, bad man
[Girls:]
You're making too much fuss
For we don't give a tinker's cuss
We've been out, yes, each of us
With a bad, bad man
We've been chasing up and down
That other show has just left town
And the one who played the clown
Was a bad, bad man
You may love us and leave us, but the parting won't grieve us
We'll turn the other cheek when the minstrels come next week
When the show folks come to call
A girl may slip but she won't fall
We'll give some but won't give all
To a bad, bad man
[Frank:]
For years I have yearned to play towns I could return to
And ""this may be it"" from the way that you speak
I'm glad you're not frightened, the atmosphere has brightened
And now let's make plans for a wonderful week
Monday when my show is done
I'll teach you how to shoot a gun
You may find it lots of fun
With a bad, bad man
Tuesday there's no matinee
But I'll be in my tent all day
You can come around and play
With a bad, bad man
Send your mothers on Wednesday because Wednesday's old hens' day
But Thursday is sublime, I'll have lots of open time
Friday night will be the test
If Saturday you're still my guest
Sunday you can come and rest

Irving Berlin,I Used To Be Color Blind Lyrics,"
                    Strange
How a dreary world can suddenly change
To a world as bright as the evening star
Queer
What a difference when your vision is clear
And you see things as they really are

I used to be color-blind
But I met you and now I find
There's green in the grass
There's gold in the moon
There's blue in the skies

That semi-circle that was always hanging about
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow
And you brought the colors out

Believe me it's really true
Till I met you I never knew
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies

I never knew there were such lovely colors
And the big surprise
Is the red in your cheeks
The gold in your hair
The blue in your eyes                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/i+used+to+be+color+blind_20068121.html,1,0,strange how a dreary world can suddenly change to a world as bright as the evening star queer what a difference when your vision is clear and you see things as they really are i used to be color-blind but i met you and now i find there's green in the grass there's gold in the moon there's blue in the skies that semi-circle that was always hanging about is not a storm cloud it's a rainbow and you brought the colors out believe me it's really true till i met you i never knew a setting sun could paint such beautiful skies i never knew there were such lovely colors and the big surprise is the red in your cheeks the gold in your hair the blue in your eyes,strange how a dreary world can suddenly change to a world as bright as the evening star queer what a difference when your vision is clear and you see things as they really are i used to be color blind but i met you and now i find there s green in the grass there s gold in the moon there s blue in the skies that semi circle that was always hanging about is not a storm cloud it s a rainbow and you brought the colors out believe me it s really true till i met you i never knew a setting sun could paint such beautiful skies i never knew there were such lovely colors and the big surprise is the red in your cheeks the gold in your hair the blue in your eyes
Irving Berlin,I Never Had A Chance Lyrics,"
                    I guess there's nothing to do
And nothing to say,
But simply go on my way
And call it a day.

I guess I'm ready to go
Right back on the shelf,
Because at last I've learned
Where you're concerned,
I've just been fooling myself.

I never had a chance,
I thought you cared for me,
But now I see I never had a chance.
I never had a chance.
Though you never told me so,
Somehow I know I never had a chance.

I knew we'd have to part,
For I could always reach your lips
But I could never reach your heart.
My dream about romance
Ended in a friendly chat.
But more than that,
I never had a chance.

I never had a chance,
I thought you cared for me,
But now I see I never had a chance.
I never had a chance.
Though you never told me so,
Somehow I know I never had a chance.

Irving Berlin,There's No Business Like Show Business Lyrics,"
                    There's no business like show business like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show

The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men because
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause.
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?

There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back?  Let's go on with the show

(there's no business like show business like no business I know)
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on

(there's no people like show people, they smile when they are low)
Yesterday they told you you would not go far, that night you open and there you are
Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the show!!

I could say you're grand and therefore I care for you so.

Venetian sons and daughters
Are strumming a new tune upon their guitars
It was written by a Latin

A gondolier who sat in
His home out in Brooklyn and gazed at the stars
He sent his melody
Across the sea

To Italy
And we know
They wrote some words to fit
That catchy bit

And christened it
The Piccolino
And we know that it's the reason
Why everyone this season

Is strumming and humming a new melody
Come to the casino
And hear them play the Piccolino
Dance with your bambino

To the strains of the catchy Piccolino
Drink your glass of vino
And when you've had your plate of scalopino
Make them play the Piccolino

The catchy Piccolino
And dance to the strains of that new melody

Verse 1:
Oh, ma hon-ey, oh, ma hon-ey, bet-ter hur-ry and let's me-an-der
Ain't you go-in'? Ain't you go-in'? To the lea-der-man, rag-ged me-ter man?
Oh, ma hon-ey, oh, ma hon-ey, Let me take you to Al-ex-an-der's
Grand stand brass band, ain't you com-in' a-long?

Chorus:
Come on and hear! Come on and hear! Al-ex-an-der's rag-time band!
Come on and hear! Come on and hear! It's the best band in the land!
They can play a bu-gle call like you nev-er heard be-fore
So nat-you-ral that you want to go to war
That's just the best-est band what am, oh, ma hon-ey lamb
Come on a-long, come on a-long, let me take you by the hand
Up to the man, the funny man, who's the lead-er of the band
And if you care to hear the Swa-nee Riv-er played in rag-time
Come on and hear, come on and hear,
Al-ex-an-der's Rag-Time Band.

Verse 2:

Irving Berlin,All Alone Lyrics,"

There is no one else but you
All alone by the telephone
Waiting for a ring, a ting-a-ling

I'm all alone every evening
All alone, feeling blue
Wond'ring where you are and how you are
And if you are all alone too



I wonder where you are (remember me) and how you are (remember me)

What'll I do?
I long for somebody who
Will sympathize with me
I'm growing so tired of living alone

Nobody loves me
That's why

All by myself in the morning
All by myself in the night

I sit alone with a table and a chair
So unhappy there
Playing solitaire

Watching the clock on the shelf

Intro:
Everything went wrong,
And the whole day long
I'd feel so blue.
For the longest while
I'd forget to smile,
Then I met you.
Now that my blue days have passed,
Now that I've found you at last -

I'll be loving you always
With a love that's true always.
When the things you've planned
Need a helping hand,
I will understand always.

Always.

That's when I'll be there always.
Not for just an hour,
Not for just a day,
Not for just a year,

Irving Berlin,An Old Fashioned Wedding Lyrics,"
                    Interpolated in 1966 revival]

[Frank:]
We'll have an old-fashioned wedding
Blessed in the good old-fashioned way

I'll vow to love you forever
You'll vow to love and honor and obey

Somewhere in some little chapel
Someday when orange blossoms bloom

We'll have an old-fashioned wedding
A simple wedding for an old-fashioned bride and groom

[Annie:]
I wanna wedding in a big church with bridesmaids and flower girls
A lot of ushers in tailcoats, reporters and photographers

A ceremony by a bishop who will tie the knot and say
""Do you agree to love and honor?"" Love and honor, yes, but not obey

I wanna wedding ring surrounded by diamonds in platinum
A big reception at the Waldorf with champagne and caviar

I wanna wedding like the Vanderbilts have, ev'rything big, not small
If I can't have that kind of a wedding I don't wanna get married at all

Irving Berlin,An Orange Grove In California Lyrics,"
                    I've a longing to go
Where the oranges grow
I know a cozy nest
'Way out west

And I miss it so
California my own
Oh how lonely I've grown
That's why I'm on the run

To the one
I left there all alone

Arm in arm we will rove
Through a sweet orange grove
Far away in California
Like a bird I mean to fly west again

And I'll hold her close to my breast again
When the blossoms unfold
And the green turns to gold
Some fine day in California

You'll see a happy girlie and a happy fellow

Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly

All of them gone
Nothing but blue skies

Irving Berlin,Can You Use Any Money Today? Lyrics,"
                    Money, money, money, money, money, money
Can you use any money today?
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Nice new bills that we're giving away

There are photographs on ev'ry one
Lincoln, Grant and Washington
Or you might like the ones with Henry Clay
Can you use any money today?

Two million, four million, six million, eight million, ten
Take what you want, when it's gone you can come back again
Bills that haven't been printed yet
You can have them by the sack

Coins that haven't been minted yet
That you never have to give back
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Uncle Sam puts it right on the line

And if we ever run out of checks for him to sign
You can have mine
All of mine
You can have mine

Money, money, money, money, money, money
Can you use any dollars today?
Money, money, money, money, money, money
We've so much that it gets in our way

In our Treas'ry there's a mighty sum
Millions we've subtracted from
The envelopes that hold our take home pay
Can you use any money today?

Home in the states underground there's a cave full of gold
Back up a truck and we'll fill it with all it can hold
Take ten million and please don't fuss
If you find it can't be spent

You can lend it right back to us
And we'll pay you seven percent
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Uncle Sam puts it right on the line

And if that feller with whiskers ever should decline
You can have mine
All of mine
You can have mine                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/can+you+use+any+money+today_21298925.html,1,0,money money money money money money can you use any money today money money money money money money nice new bills that we're giving away there are photographs on ev'ry one lincoln grant and washington or you might like the ones with henry clay can you use any money today two million four million six million eight million ten take what you want when it's gone you can come back again bills that haven't been printed yet you can have them by the sack coins that haven't been minted yet that you never have to give back money money money money money money uncle sam puts it right on the line and if we ever run out of checks for him to sign you can have mine all of mine you can have mine money money money money money money can you use any dollars today money money money money money money we've so much that it gets in our way in our treas'ry there's a mighty sum millions we've subtracted from the envelopes that hold our take home pay can you use any money today home in the states underground there's a cave full of gold back up a truck and we'll fill it with all it can hold take ten million and please don't fuss if you find it can't be spent you can lend it right back to us and we'll pay you seven percent money money money money money money uncle sam puts it right on the line and if that feller with whiskers ever should decline you can have mine all of mine you can have mine,money money money money money money can you use any money today money money money money money money nice new bills that we re giving away there are photographs on ev ry one lincoln grant and washington or you might like the ones with henry clay can you use any money today two million four million six million eight million ten take what you want when it s gone you can come back again bills that haven t been printed yet you can have them by the sack coins that haven t been minted yet that you never have to give back money money money money money money uncle sam puts it right on the line and if we ever run out of checks for him to sign you can have mine all of mine you can have mine money money money money money money can you use any dollars today money money money money money money we ve so much that it gets in our way in our treas ry there s a mighty sum millions we ve subtracted from the envelopes that hold our take home pay can you use any money today home in the states underground there s a cave full of gold back up a truck and we ll fill it with all it can hold take ten million and please don t fuss if you find it can t be spent you can lend it right back to us and we ll pay you seven percent money money money money money money uncle sam puts it right on the line and if that feller with whiskers ever should decline you can have mine all of mine you can have mine

Just holding you tightly

Though it's called dancing
To me it's romancing

Makes you easy to dance with
That is why I'm always right on the beat

In one man's arms
Makes you easy to dance with

Irving Berlin,"You'd Be Surprised, Song (from ""Ziegfeld Follies Of 1919"") Lyrics","
                    [1st verse:]
Johnny was bashful and shy
Nobody understood why 
Mary loved him
All the other girls passed him by
Everyone wanted to know
How she could pick such a beau
With a twinkle in her eye
She made this reply
[1st chorus:]
He's not so good in a crowd but when you get him alone
You'd be surprised
He isn't much at a dance but then when he takes you home
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look like much of a lover
But don't judge a book by it's cover
He's got the face of an Angel
But there's a Devil in his eye
He's such a delicate thing but when he starts in to squeeze
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look very strong but when you sit on his knee
You'd be surprised
At a party or at a ball
I've got to admit that he's nothing at all
But in a morris chair
You'd be surprised
[2nd verse:]
Mary continued to praise
Johnny's remarkable ways
To the ladies
And you know advertising pays
Now Johnny's never alone
He has the busiest phone
Almost every other day
A new girl will say
[2nd chorus:]
He's not so good in the house but on a bench in the park
You'd be surprised
He isn't much in the light but when he gets in the dark 
You'd be surprised
I know he looks as slow as the Erie
But you don't know the half of it, dearie
He looks as cold as an Eskimo
But there's fire in his eyes
He doesn't say very much but when he starts in to speak
You'd be surprised
He's not so good at the start but at the end of the week
You'd be surprised
On a streetcar or in a train
You'd think he was born without any brain
But in a taxicab

Irving Berlin,You Keep Coming Back Like A Song Lyrics,"
                    Can't run away from you, dear
I've tried so hard but I fear
You'll always follow me near and far
Just when I think that I'm set
Just when I've learned to forget
I close my eyes, dear, and there you are

You keep coming back like a song
A song that keeps saying, remember

The sweet used-to-be
That was once you and me
Keeps coming back like an old melody

The perfume of roses in may
Returns to my room in december

Irving Berlin,You Can't Get A Man With A Gun Lyrics,"
                    Oh, my mother was frightened by a shotgun, they say
That's why I'm such a wonderful shot.
I'd be out in the cactus and I'd practice all day,
And now tell me what have I got?
I'm quick on the trigger with targets not much bigger than a pinpoint
I'm number one, but my score with a feller
Is lower than a celler, oh you can't get a man with a gun.
When I'm with a pistol, I sparkle like a crystal
Yes, I shine like the morning sun,
But I lose all my luster, when with a bronco buster,
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun
If I went to battle with someone's herd of cattle
You'd have steak when the job was done.
But, if I shot the herder, they'd holler bloody murder
And you can't shoot a male in the tail like a quail,
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
I'm cool, brave, and daring to see a lion glaring
When I'm out with my Remington.
But a look from a mister will raise a fever blister
Oh you can't get a man with a gun
The gals with umbrellas are always out with fellers
In the rain or the blazin sun
But a man never trifles with gals who carry rifles
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun.
A man's love is mighty, he'll even buy a nightie
For a gal who he thinks is fun.
But they don't buy pajamas for pistol packin mamas
And you can't get a hug from a mug, with a slug
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.

Irving Berlin,You Can't Brush Me Off Lyrics,"
                    Why don't you just give in?
Just like a Siamese twin
I mean to stick to you
Until you do
I won't take it on the chin
You'll never leave me flat
I'm not a ""last year's hat""
That you can cast aside
I've got my pride
And I won't stand for that
You can't brush me off
As you would a speck of powder, you may try
But you can't brush me off
You can't shout me down
You can yell but I'll yell louder, you can try
But you can't brush me off
You can say you're out but I'll keep phoning
You can tell me goodbye
You can tell me but I
Won't go
No
You can't leave me cold
As you would a plate of chowder, you may try
But you can't brush me off

What is this all about?
You've got me wrong, no doubt
I give you all my time
Believe me, I'm
Not looking for some way out
I want you for my wife
Sharing my care and strife
And that may not be fun
For when it's done
You're stuck with me for life
You can't brush me off
As you would a fresh mosquito, you may try
But you can't brush me off
You can't rub me out
Like a spot on my tuxedo, you may try
But you can't brush me off
You can cut me dead but I won't mind it
You may injure my pride
Still I'll never decide
To go
No
You can't drop me fast
As you would a live torpedo, you may try
But you can't brush me off
[3]
You can't brush me off
Like a colored pullman porter, you may try
But you can't brush me off
You can't lock me out
Like a frightened farmer's daughter, you may try
But you can't brush me off
You can drop a hint but I won't take it
You can tell me bad news

To go

Irving Berlin,You Can Have Him Lyrics,"
                    [maizie:]
You can have him
I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
I'm giving him the sack
And he can go right back where he came from
I could never make him happy
He'd be better off with you
I'm afraid I never loved him
All I ever wanted to do was

Run my fingers thru his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near
Give him babies one for ev'ry year, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him
For he's not the man for me

[monique:]
You can have him
I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
He isn't my concern
And he can just return where he came from
I would look a trifle silly
Taking him away from you
That was never my intention
All I ever wanted to do was

Close the window while he soundly slept
Raid the icebox where the food is kept
Cook a breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray
After breakfast clear the things away
Bring the papers and when they've been read
Spend the balance of the day in bed, so you see

Irving Berlin,"Who Do You Love, I Hope Lyrics","
                    I've got the question
I've had it for days
You've got the answer, dear
I'll put the question
In one little phrase
Say what I want to hear

Who do you love I hope
Who would you kiss I hope
Who is it going to be
I hope, I hope, I hope it's me

Who do you want I hope
Who do you need I hope
Who is it going to be
I hope, I hope, I hope it's me

Is it the baker who gave you a cake
I saw that look in his eye
Is it the butcher who brought you a steak
Say that it is and I'll die

Who do you love I hope
Who would you kiss I hope
Who is it going to be
I hope, I hope, I hope it's me

I heard your question
The answer you know
Love is my middle name
You asked a question
That worried you so
Mind if I do the same

Who do you love I hope
Who would you kiss I hope
Who is it going to be
I hope, I hope, I hope it's me

Who do you want I hope
Who do you need I hope
Who is it going to be
I hope, I hope, I hope it's me

Is it the blondie who acted so shy
I heard the things that she said
Is it the redhead who gave you the eye
Say that it is and your dead

Who do you love I hope
Who would you kiss I hope
Who is it going to be

                    Gone is the romance that was so divine.
'tis broken and cannot be mended.
You must go your way,
And I must go mine.
But now that our love dreams have ended...

What'll I do
When you are far away
And I am blue
What'll I do?

What'll I do?
When I am wond'ring who
Is kissing you
What'll I do?

What'll I do with just a photograph
To tell my troubles to?

When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true
What'll I do?

In those Lenox Avenue clothes
Mister Dude has disappeared with his flashy tie
You'll see in the Harlem Esquire
What the well-dressed man will desire
When he's struttin' down the street with his sweetie-pie

Sun tan, shade of green
Or an olive drab color scheme
That's what the well-dressed man in Harlem will wear

Dressed up in O.D.'s
With a tin hat for overseas
That's what the well-dressed man in Harlem will wear

Top hat, white tie and tails no more
They've been put away till after the war

Irving Berlin,What Chance Have I With Love? Lyrics,"
                    Love is beautiful, love is swell
Love is as sweet as a nut
Love is grander than tongue can tell
Love is remarkable, but
Look at what it did to Antony
It made a fool out of Antony
If love could do that to Antony
What chance have I with love?
Look at what it did to Romeo
It dealt poor Romey an awful blow
If love could do that to Romeo
What chance have I with love?
Look at what it did to Samson
'Til he lost his hair he was brave
If a haircut could weaken Samson
They could murder me with a shave
Look at what it did to Bonaparte
He lost his head when he lost his heart
If he kicked over the apple cart
What chance have I
An ordinary guy

They listened while a sergeant was laying down the law
They stood there at attention, their faces turning red
The sergeant looked them over and this is what he said

You had your breakfast in bed before
But you won't have it there any more
This is the Army, Mister Green!
We like the barracks nice and clean
You had a housemaid to clean your floor
But she won't help you out any more
Do what the buglers command
They're in the Army and not in a band

Irving Berlin,The Little Things In Life Lyrics,"
                    Great big houses with great big rooms
Were not fashioned for brides and grooms
A little place is where we should be
Great big troubles and great big cares

Come from houses with marble stairs
A little place for you and for me

Just a little room or two can more than do a little man and wife
That's if they're contented with the little things in life
Living on a larger scale would soon entail a lot of care and strife
We could be so happy with the little things in life

A little rain, a little sun, a little work, a little fun
A little time for loving when the day is done
And a little thing that cries for lullabies could make a man and wife

Irving Berlin,The Song Is Ended Lyrics,"
                    My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone

Irving Berlin,The Hostess With The Mostes' On The Ball Lyrics,"
                    I was born on a thousand acres of Oklahoma land
Nothing grew on the thousand acres for it was gravel and sand
One day father started digging in a field
Hoping to find some soil
He dug and he dug and what do you think?
Oil, oil, oil
The money rolled in and I rolled out with a fortune piled so high
Washington was my destination
And now who am I?
I'm the chosen party giver
For the White House clientele
And they know that I deliver
What it takes to make 'em jell
And in Washington I'm known by one and all
As the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
They could go to Elsa Maxwell
When they had an axe to grind
They could always grind their axe well
At the parties she designed
Now the hatchet grinders all prefer to call
On the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
I've a great big bar and good caviar
Yes, the best that can be found
And a large amount in my bank account
When election time comes 'round
If you're feeling presidential
You can make it, yes, indeed
There are just three things essential
Let me tell you all you need
Is an ounce of wisdom and a pound of gall
And the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
An Ambassador has just reached the shore
He's a man of many loves
An important gent from the Orient
To be handled with kid gloves
He can come and let his hair down
Have the best time of his life
Even bring his new affair down
Introduce her as his wife
But she mustn't leave her panties in the hall
For the hostess who's the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
[Encore:]
I've been highly complimented
And I thank you what is more
You'll be damned well represented
By your new ambassador
For my one ambition is to make them fall
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
In the handbag that I'll carry
There's a precious little note
To their highnesses from Harry
Introducing me he wrote:
""I'll appreciate a favor large or small
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball""
There'll be no mistakes, I've got what it takes
To make friends across the sea
I'll make being smart an important part
Of my foreign policy
I'll cement our good relations
When I give my first affair
There'll be special invitations

How'll I keep explainin' when they ask me where he's gone?
How'll I keep from cryin' when I bring their supper on?

How can I be thankful when they start to thank the lord

Where your pappy's workin' in the moonlight

Irving Berlin,My Defenses Are Down Lyrics,"
                    Frank butler:
I've had my way with so many girls
An' was lots of fun.
My scheme was to know many girls
To keep me safe from one
I find it can be done.
My defenses are down
She's broken my resistance
And I don't know where I am
I went into the fight like a lion
But I came out like a lamb.
My defenses are down
She's got me where she wants me
And I can't escape no how
I could speak to my heart when it wakened
But my heart won't listen now.
Like a toothless, clawless tiger,
Like an organ-grinder's bear,
Like a knight without his armor,
Like Samson without his hair.
My defenses are down
I might as well surrender
For the battle can't be won.
But I must confess that I like it,
So there's nothing to be done.
Yes, I must confess that I like it
Being miserable's gonna be fun

His defenses are down
She's broken my resistance
And he's in an awful jam.

Everything in it's place as it should be

Because I find myself with

No strings and no connections
No ties to my affections

No dates that can't be broken
No words that can't be spoken
Especially when I am feeling romancy

Like a robin upon a tree
Like a sailor that goes to sea
Like an unwritten melody

Irving Berlin,Now It Can Be Told Lyrics,"

History placed them in a romantic set
In between book covers they are side by side
But the real thing hasn't been written yet

Now it can be told
Told in all it's glory
Now that we have met
The world may know the sentimental story

The greatest romance they ever knew
Is waiting to
Unfold

Now it can be told

Of boy meets girl is just an imitation

Irving Berlin,Oh How That German Could Love! Lyrics,"
                    [1st verse:]
Once I got stuck on a sweet little German
And oh what a German was she
The best that was walking, well what's the use talking
Was just made to order for me
So lovely, and witty, more yet she was pretty
You don't know until you have tried
She had such a figure, it couldn't be bigger
And there was some more yet beside

[chorus:]
Oh how that German could love
With a feeling that came from the heart
She called me her honey, her angel, her money
She pushed ev'ry word out so smart
She spoke like a speaker, and oh what a speech
Like no other speaker could speak
Ach my what a German when she kissed her Herman
It stayed on my cheek for a week

[2nd verse:]
This girl could squeeze, and it never would hurt
For that lady knew just how to squeeze
Her loving was killing, more yet she was willing
You never would have to say please
I just couldn't stop her, for dinner and supper
Some kisses and hugs was the food
When she wasn't nice it was more better twice
When she's bad she was better than good

[2nd chorus]
Oh how that German could love
With a sweetness that's sweeter than sweet
Just say what you please, you would hug and you'd squeeze
Just the shoes that she wore on her feet
Her smile was like money that somebody owed you
That somebody wanted to give
When you felt like dying and she started sighing
Ach my it was worthwhile to live

[3rd verse:]
Sometimes we'd love for a week at a time
And it only would seem like a day
How well I remember, one night in December
I felt like the middle of May
I'll bet all I'm worth that when she came on earth
All the angels went out on parade
No other one turned up, I think that they burned up
The pattern from which she was made

[3rd chorus:]
Oh how that German could love
With a love like you see in a play
When she said, ""My dear,"" it would ring in my ear
For a year, and a week and a day
Her no was like yes, and her yes was like no
It was something like yes, it was, well
When we got together ach donner und vetter

Oh! How I hate to get up in the morning
Oh! How I'd love to remain in bed

Ya gotta get up
Ya gotta get up this morning

Someday they're going to find him dead

Irving Berlin,Overture Lyrics,"
                    [On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist,

Irving Berlin,Pack Up Your Sins And Go To The Devil Lyrics,"
                    Oh, I got a message from below
'Twas from a man I used to know
About a year or so ago, before he departed
He is just as happy as can be

I'll tell you what he said to me
He said, ""If ever you get heavy-hearted
Pack up your sins and go to the devil in Hades
You'll meet the finest of gentlemen and the finest of ladies
They'd rather be down below than up above

Hades is full of thousands of Joneses and Browns
O'Hoolihans, Cohens, and Bradys
You'll hear a heavenly tune that went to the devil
Because the jazz bands they started pickin' it
Then put a trick in it, a jazzy kick in it

They've got a couple of old reformers in heaven
Making them go to bed at eleven
Pack up your sins and go to the Devil
And you'll never have to go to bed at all

If you care to dwell where the weather is hot
H-E-double-L is a wonderful spot
If you need a rest and you're all out of sorts
Hades is the best of the winter resorts

Paradise doesn't compare: all the nice people are there
They come there from everywhere
Just to revel with Mister Devil
Nothing on his mind but a couple of horns

Satan is waitin' with his jazz band
And his band came from Alabam' with a melody hot
No one gives a damn if it's music or not
Satan's melody makes you want to dance forever
And you never have to go to bed at all                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/ + /i/irving+berlin/pack+up+your+sins+and+go+to+the+devil_21300179.html,1,0,oh i got a message from below 'twas from a man i used to know about a year or so ago before he departed he is just as happy as can be i'll tell you what he said to me he said if ever you get heavy-hearted pack up your sins and go to the devil in hades you'll meet the finest of gentlemen and the finest of ladies they'd rather be down below than up above hades is full of thousands of joneses and browns o'hoolihans cohens and bradys you'll hear a heavenly tune that went to the devil because the jazz bands they started pickin' it then put a trick in it a jazzy kick in it they've got a couple of old reformers in heaven making them go to bed at eleven pack up your sins and go to the devil and you'll never have to go to bed at all if you care to dwell where the weather is hot h-e-double-l is a wonderful spot if you need a rest and you're all out of sorts hades is the best of the winter resorts paradise doesn't compare all the nice people are there they come there from everywhere just to revel with mister devil nothing on his mind but a couple of horns satan is waitin' with his jazz band and his band came from alabam' with a melody hot no one gives a damn if it's music or not satan's melody makes you want to dance forever and you never have to go to bed at all,oh i got a message from below twas from a man i used to know about a year or so ago before he departed he is just as happy as can be i ll tell you what he said to me he said if ever you get heavy hearted pack up your sins and go to the devil in hades you ll meet the finest of gentlemen and the finest of ladies they d rather be down below than up above hades is full of thousands of joneses and browns o hoolihans cohens and bradys you ll hear a heavenly tune that went to the devil because the jazz bands they started pickin it then put a trick in it a jazzy kick in it they ve got a couple of old reformers in heaven making them go to bed at eleven pack up your sins and go to the devil and you ll never have to go to bed at all if you care to dwell where the weather is hot h e double l is a wonderful spot if you need a rest and you re all out of sorts hades is the best of the winter resorts paradise doesn t compare all the nice people are there they come there from everywhere just to revel with mister devil nothing on his mind but a couple of horns satan is waitin with his jazz band and his band came from alabam with a melody hot no one gives a damn if it s music or not satan s melody makes you want to dance forever and you never have to go to bed at all

As soft and as pink as a nursery

Will wear satins and laces and smell of cologne

Her nails will be polished and, in her hair,
She'll wear a gardenia and I'll be there
'stead of flittin', I'll be sittin'

Irving Berlin,Play A Simple Melody Lyrics,"
                    Part 1: (speak unless * is there
Wont play a simple melody
Just like my mother sang to me
*she sang she sang to mee* (smooth)
One with good old fanioned harmony
Why don't you play a simple melody
*a simple melody a simple melo-* (smooth)
(Now go straight into singing 2)

Part 2:
Won't you Play A Simple Melody
Like my mother sang to me?
One with good old fashioned harmony
Play A Simple Melody

Part 3:
Musical demon, set your honey a'dreamin'
Won't you play me some rag?
Just change that classical nag
To some sweet beautiful drag

If you will play from a copy of a tune that is choppy
You'll get all my applause
And that is simply because
I want to listen to rag

Part 4:
My heart is palpitatin'
From all this syncopation
When I hear a ba-_nd
And when I'm with my honey
My feet start actin' funny
When I hear a band
It's really not surprisin'
My temp'rature keeps risin'

Irving Berlin,Cheek To Cheek Lyrics,"
                    Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek
Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
(come on and) dance with me
I want my arm(s) about you
That (those) charm(s) about you
Will carry me through...
(right up) to heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (swinging)
Out together dancing cheek to cheek

Irving Berlin,A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody Lyrics,"
                    [Verse]
I have an ear for music, and I have an eye for a maid
I like a pretty girlie, with each pretty tune that's played
They go together
Like sunny weather
Goes with the month of May
I've studied girls and music, so I'm qualified to say

[Chorus]
A pretty girl is like a melody
That haunts you night and day
Just like the strain
Of a haunting [Refrain]
She'll start upon a marathon and run around your brain
You can't escape she's in your memory
By morning, night and noon
She will leave you and then
Come back again

If I seem to scintillate
It's because I've got a date
A date with a package of
The good things that come with love

Why I feel sublime
I'm

Steppin' out with my honey
Can't be bad to feel so good
Never felt quite so sunny
And I keep on knockin' wood

There'll be smooth sailin' 'cause I'm trimmin' my sails
With a bright shine on my shoes and on my nails

Irving Berlin,Something To Dance About Lyrics,"
                    An old hand at giving parties
And I've learned an awful lot
The best reason for a party
And what keeps it boiling hot
An occasion when you've got

Something to dance about
Someone to dance it with
Something to dance it to
To a fox-trot or a waltz

Put on your dancing shoes
Here comes some happy news
Break up in twos and twos
To a fox-trot or a waltz

You and someone have parted
And your lonely heart yearns
While you're there broken hearted
Suddenly he returns

That's something to dance about
With someone to dance it with
Pick something to dance it to
To a fox-trot or a waltz

To a Charleston or a waltz
To a Tango or a waltz

Dance to the blues
Something to dance about
Someone to dance it with
Something to dance it to Blues

Dance it to a rhumba

Let us hide behind a pair of fancy glasses
And make faces when a member of the classes passes

Let's go smelling where they're dwelling
Sniffing ev'rything the way they do

Let us go to it, they do it
Why can't we do it too?
Let's go slumming, nose thumbing, on park avenue

Let's go slumming, take me slumming
Let's go slumming on park avenue

Where the social hearts for broadway lights are throbbing
And they spend their nights in smart cafes hobknobbing, snobbing

Come let's eye them, pass right by them
Looking down our noses as they do

The same in the rain and sun
Two different faces, but in tight places

Irving Berlin,Change Partners Lyrics,"
                    Must you dance every dance with the same fortunate man?
You have danced with him since the music began.
Won't you change partners and dance with me?
Must you dance quite so close with your lips touching his face?
Can't you see
I'm longing to be in his place?
Won't you change partners and dance with me?

Ask him to sit this one out.
While you're alone,
I'll tell the waiter to tell
Him he's wanted on the telephone.

You've been locked in his arms ever since heaven-knows-when.

Irving Berlin,Russian Lullaby Lyrics,"

There's a lonely russian rose
Gazing tenderly
Down upon her knee
Where a baby's brown eyes glisten

Ev'ry night you'll hear her croon
A russian lullaby

Just a little plaintive tune
When baby starts to cry

Rock-a-bye my baby
Somewhere there may be

A land that's free for you and me

Irving Berlin,A Fella With An Umbrella Lyrics,"
                    I'm just a fella, a fella with an umbrella,
Looking for a girl who saved her love for a rainy day.
I'm just a fella, a fella with an umbrella,
Glad to see the skies of blue have turned into skies of gray.
Raindrops have brought us together,
And that's what I long to see.
Maybe the break in the weather will prove to be a break for me.
So I'll be the fella, that fella with an umbrella,
If you'll be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.

Oh, the raindrops have brought us together,
And that's what I long to see.
Maybe the break in the weather will prove to be a big break for me.
So I'll be the fella, the kid with the small umbrella,
If you'll be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.

Irving Berlin,Remember Lyrics,"
                    One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret
One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember the night
The night you said, ""i love you""
Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

[2]
Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
You loved me too, my dreams had come true, and all the world was
May
But soon the maytime turned to december

Irving Berlin,Puttin' On The Ritz Lyrics,"
                    Have you seen the well-to-do
Upon Lennox Avenue
On that famous thoroughfare
With their noses in the air

High hats and narrow collars
White spats and fifteen dollars
Spending every dime
For a wonderful time

If you're blue
And you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where Harlem sits
Puttin' on the Ritz
Spangled Gowns upon the bevy of
High browns from down the levy
All misfits
Puttin' on the Ritz

That's where each and every lulu-belle goes
Every Thursday evening with her swell beaus
Rubbin' elbows

Come with me and we'll attend their jubilee
And see them spend
Their last two bits
Puttin' on the Ritz

------ short instrumental break ------

(Boys, look at that man puttin' on that Ritz)
(You look at him, I can't)

If you're blue
And you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where Harlem flits
Puttin' on the Ritz
Spangled Gowns upon the bevy of
High browns from down the levy
All misfits
Puttin' on that certain Ritz

Every Thursday evening with her swell beaus
Rubbin' elbows

 Oh listen, sister, 
 I love my mister man, 
 And I can't tell yo' why, 
 Dere ain't no reason 
 Why I should love dat man. 
 It must be sumpin' dat de angels done plan. 

 Refrain: 

 Fish got to swim, birds got to fly, 
 I got to love one man till I die. 
 Can't help lovin' dat man of mine. 
 Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow, 
 Tell me I'm crazy (maybe I know). 
 Can't help lovin' dat man of mine. 
 When he goes away 
 Dat's a rainy day, 
 But when he comes back dat day is fine, 
 De sun will shine! 
 He kin come home as late as kin be, 
 Home widout him ain't no home to me. 
 Can't help lovin' dat man of mine. 
 ~~~ 
 My man is shif'less 
 An' good for nuthin' too 
 (He's mah man jes' de same) 

 He's never round here 
 When dere is work to do. 
 He's never round here when dere's workin' to do. 
 De chimbley's smokin', 
 De roof is leakin' in, 
 But he don't seem to care. 
 He kin be happy 
 Wid jes' a sip of gin. 
 Ah even love him when his kisses got gin!

Leave it to Jane, Jane, Jane
I don't know why you should make me
Ask of a plan from you
She is the girl with brains

I've always tried to do
Every thing I can for you
No problem you can wish
On her, gives her a strain

She'll tackle many a storm, and daily
If something is on your mind
And I can see that there is
Not a doubt of it

Comfort you soon will find
Leave it to me
I can get you out of it
If you have started worrying
Kindly refrain
And just hand over the whole thing to Jane

(Spoken)
Well Jane
Why don't you tell us
How do you do it?
Yes Jane, come on Jane, tell us
Oh well, it's really very simple
I just study up on the famous

Jerome Kern,Make Believe Lyrics,"
                    Perfromed by Tony Martin and Kathryn Grayson) 

 Verse 1 

 The game of ""just supposing"" is the sweetest game I know, 
 Our dreams are more romantic than the world we see. 
 And if the things we dream about don't happen to be so, 
 That's just an unimportant technicality. 

 Refrain: 

 We could make believe I love you, 
 Only make believe that you love me. 
 Others find peace of mind in pretending; 

 Couldn't you?  Couldn't I?  Couldn't we 
 Make believe our lips are blending 
 In a phantom kiss or two, or three? 
 Might as well make believe I love you, 
 For to tell the truth, I do. 

 Verse 2 

 Your pardon I pray, 'twas too much to say, 
 The words that betray my heart. 
 We only pretend, 
 You do not offend, 
 In playing a lover's part.

Jerome Kern,Smoke Gets In Your Eyes Lyrics,"
                    They asked me how I knew my true love was true,
I of course replied, something here inside cannot be denied.
They said someday you'll find all who love are blind,
When your heart's on fire, you must realize,
Smoke gets in your eyes.
So I chaffed and then I gaily laughed,
To think that they could doubt my love,
Yet today, my love has flown away,
I am without my love.

Jerome Kern,Ol' Man River Lyrics,"
                    Performed by Frank Sinatra)

Here we all work 'long the Mississippi
Here we all work while the white folk play
Pullin' them boats from the dawn till sunset
Gettin' no rest till the judgment day

Don't look up and don't look down
Ya don't dast make the white boss frown
Bend your knees and bow your head
And pull that rope until you're dead

Let me go 'way from the Mississippi
Let me go 'way from the white man boss
Show me that stream called the River Jordan
That's the old stream that I long to cross
Ol' Man River, that Ol' Man River
He must know somepin', but he don't say nothin'
He just keeps rollin', he keeps on rollin' along

He don't plant taters, and he don't plant cotton
And them what plants 'em is soon forgotten
But Ol' Man River, jest keeps rollin' along

You and me, we sweat and strain
Bodies all achin' and wracked with pain
Tote that barge and lift that bale
Ya get a little drunk and ya lands    in ja-ail

I gets weary and so sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin', but I'm feared of dyin'
And Ol' Man River, he just keeps rollin' along

Nothing to do you say

Back to the bygone days 
Sail to the old village school house 
Anchor outside the school door 
Look in and see, there's you and there's me 
A couple of kids once more 

School days, school days 
Dear old golden rule days 
Readin' and 'ritin' and 'rithmetic 
Taught to the tune of the hickory stick 
You were my queen in calico 
I was your bashful barefoot beau 
And you wrote on my slate, ""I love you, Joe"" 
When we were a couple of kids 

'Member the hill, Nellie Darling 
And the oak tree that grew on its brow 
They've built forty storeys upon that old hill 
And the oak's an old chestnut now 
'Member the meadows so green, dear 
So fragrant with clover and maize 
Into new city lots and preferred bus'ness plots 
They've cut them up since those days

How I hate you, you alligator bait, you
An' here's the reason why

You're knock kneed, pigeon toed, box ankled
You're big foot, barefoot slue footed too
How'd they ever get a pair of shoes on you
Your short and squatty, just nobody

And break my heart in two

And all my love was a [big fat] waste of time
Someday your heart will be broken like mine
So why should I cry over you
So why should I cry over you

Johnny Mercer,Winter Wonderland Lyrics,"
                    I really can't stay
But, baby, it's cold outside
I got to go way
But. Baby, it's cold outside
This evening's has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So I'd  better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Maybe just a half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hand, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride
I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out
Ahh, but it's cold outside

I simply must go
But, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no
But, baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is visious
Eww, your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But, baby, you'll freeze out there
See ya, say, lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand

With Paul Weston and the Pied Pipers
Winter Wonderland
""Now for a little change in pace we've sent Johnny Mercer up to the bandstand to join Paul Weston and the Pied Pipers in the nostalgic song of Christmas time, Winter Wonderland.""
Sleigh bells ring.
Are you listening?
In the lane,
Snow is glistening.
A beautiful sight.
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird;
Here to stay is a new bird.
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?""
We'll say, ""No man.""
But you can do the job when you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream
By the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
We'll pretend our snowman's parson brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?""
We'll say, ""No man.""
But you can do the job
When you're in town.Ooh ooh!
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream
By the fire
To face unafraid

Johnny Mercer,I'm Old Fashioned Lyrics,"
                    I am not such a clever one about the latest fads
I admit I was never one adored by local lads
Not that I ever tried to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint

I'm old fashioned, I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This years fancies are passing fancies
But sighing sighs, holding hands
These my heart understands

I'm old fashioned but I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me.

Johnny Mercer,I Thought About You Lyrics,"
                    Seems that I read, or somebody said
That out of sight is out of mind
Maybe that's so but I tried to go
And leave you behind, what did I find

I took a trip on the train
And I thought about you,
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you,

Two or three cars parked under the stars
A winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, same old dream

At every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
But when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue,

I peeked through the crack
And looked at the track
The one going back to you

And never gone nowhere

Her words were sweet like wine 
She bought him diamonds and limousines 
She stole that man o' mine 

When night comes a-creepin' 
For me there's no sleeping 
What she sews, she'll be reapin' 
'Cause she done me wrong

Johnny Mercer,Hooray For Hollywood Lyrics,"
                    Hooray for Hollywood
That screwy ballyhooey Hollywood
Where any office boy or young mechanic can be a panic
With just a good looking pan
And any barmaid can be a star maid
If she dances with or without a fan

Hooray for Hollywood,
Where you're terrific if you're even good
Where anyone at all from Shirley Temple to Aimee Semple
Is equally understood
Go out and try your luck, you might be Donald Duck
Hooray for Hollywood

Hooray for Hollywood
That phoney super-Coney Hollywood
They come from Chillicothes and Paducas with their bazookas
To get their names up in lights
All armed with photos from local rotos
With their hair in ribbon and legs in tights

Hooray for Hollywood
You may be homely in your neighbourhood
But if you think that you can be an actor, see Mr. Factor
He'll make a monkey look good
Within a half an hour you'll look like Tyrone Power
Hooray for Hollywood

Johnny Mercer,Goofus Lyrics,"
                    I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""

Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""

Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Johnny Mercer,Fools Rush In Lyrics,"
                    ""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ahh, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in

Johnny Mercer,Hooray For Love Lyrics,"

It's a rocket to the moon;

But once you get that glow!

Here's to my first romance,

And to complete the list,
Here's to the boys who said,
""No!"".

Make this a night for love,
If we have to fight, let's fight for love!

Some waste away for love;

With a touch of ""Clare De Lune""!
It gets you high, it gets you low,
But once you get that glow, oh!

Others have to take off weight for love!
Some go berserk for love,
Lovers even go to work for love!

People have their noses bobbed for love!

Johnny Mercer,The Girl Friend Of The Whirling Dervish Lyrics,"
                    One fine day, I chanced to stray
On a little side street in old Bombay
And met a sentimental oriental
She saw me and I saw she
Had a manner too bold and much too free
Her eyes were positively detrimental
When I asked about this gay coquette
I discovered much to my regret

She's the girl friend of the whirling dervish
She's the sweetest one he's found
But ev'ry night, in the mellow moonlight
When he's out dervishing with all his might
She gives him the run-around

All the boy friends of the whirling dervish
Are his best friends to his face
But there's no doubt, when he isn't about
They all come hurrying to take her out
She leads him a dizzy pace

He dreams of a Hindu honeymoon
He doesn't dream that ev'ry night when he goes out
To make an honest rupee
She steps out to make a lotta whoopee

Oh, the love song of the whirling dervish
Has a sweet and tender sound
But will he burn if he ever should learn
That while he's doing her a real good turn
She gives him the runaround

She's got a nervish, throwin' him a curvish
Which, of course, he doesn't deservish

Johnny Mercer,Summer Wind Lyrics,"

It lingered there to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long, we sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flying by
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind and the winter winds, they have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies, through nights that never end
My fick-le friend, the summer wind

The summer wind

Johnny Mercer,Sweet Georgia Brown Lyrics,"
                    She just got here yesterday,
Things are hot here now they say,
There's a new gal in town.
Gals are jealous, there's no doubt. 
All the guys just rave about
Sweet, Sweet Georgia Brown.
And ever since she came, the common folks all claim, say;

No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).
It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town.
Since she came why it's a shame how she's cooled 'em down.
Fellas that she can't get must be fellas that she ain't met.
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her, Sweet Georgia Brown. 

All you gals will get the blues, 
all you pals will surely lose.
And, there's but one excuse.
Now I've told you who she was, 
and I've told you what she does,
Still, give this gal her dues.
This pretty maiden's prayer is answered anywhere 

No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).
All those tips the porter slips to Sweet Georgia Brown
They buy clothes at fashion shows for one dollar down.

Johnny Mercer,Sweet Lorraine Lyrics,"
                    Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,

(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine

Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess,

Johnny Mercer,That Old Black Magic Lyrics,"
                    Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for

Johnny Mercer,Small Fry Lyrics,"

He's such a devil I could whip him with joy
He's been carousin' at the burleycue
Just watch me teach him with the sole of my shoe

Small fry, struttin' by the pool room
Small fry, should be in the school room
My, my, put down that cigarette
You ain't grown up high and mighty yet

Small fry, dancin' for a penny
Small fry, countin' up how many
My, my, just listen here to me
You ain't the biggest catfish in the sea

You practice peckin' all day long to some old radio song
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, you better listen to your paw
And someday practice the law
And then you'll be a real success

Yes, small fry, you kissed the neighbour's daughter
Small fry, shoulda stay in shallow water
Seems I should take you cross my knee
You ain't the biggest catfish in the sea

You've got your feet all soakin' wet
You'll be the death of me yet

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music of the night?
Wonderful music
Faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there

Haven't you heard the music in the night?

Faint as a will o' the wisp

Johnny Mercer,Royal Garden Blues Lyrics,"
                    No use of talkin' no use of talkin'
You'll start in dog-walkin' no matter where.
There's jazz-copation blues modulation,
Just like a Haitian you'll rip and tear.
Most everybody likes the blues

Here's why I'm ravin', here's why I'm ravin'
If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.
You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""
Because your feet they can't refuse.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane;
Can't keep still, Tho it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree;
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody Grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan?, Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, But Royal Garden Blues.

Johnny Mercer,Personality Lyrics,"

Johnny Mercer
Words by Johnny Burke
Music by Jimmy Van Heusen

Peaked at # 1 in 1946
Competing versions charted by Bing Crosby (#9) and Dinah Shore (#10)
Sung by Dorothy Lamour in ""The Road To Utopia"" also starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby

When Madam Pompadour was on a ballroom floor
Said all the gentlemen ""Obviously,""
""The madam has the cutest personality""

And think of all the books about Du Barry's looks
What was it made her the toast of Paree?
She had a well-developed personality

(What did Romeo see in Juliet?)
(Or Figaro in Figarette?)
(Or Jupiter in Juno?)
You know!

And when Salome danced and had the boys entranced
No doubt it must have been easy to see
That she knew how to use her personality

(A girl can learn to spell and take dictation well)
(And never sit on the boss's left knee)
(Unless she's got a perfect personality)

(A girl can get somewhere in spite of stringy hair)
(Or even just a bit bowed at the knee)
(If she can show a faultless personality)

Why are certain girls offered certain things
Like sable coats and wedding rings?
By men who wear their spats right?
(That's right!)

(So don'tcha say ""I'm smart and have the kindest heart""
(Or ""what a wonderful sister I'd be"")

Just tell me how you like my

Johnny Mercer,Out Of This World Lyrics,"

When I'm looking at you,
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew.

You're right out of a book,
The fairy tale I read when I was so high;
No armoured knight out of a book
Could find a more enchanted Lorelei than I.

After waiting so long for the right time,
After reaching so long for a star,
All at once from the long and lonely night time,
And despite time, here you are!

I'd fly out of this world
If you said we were through,
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two with you;
I'll spend the next eternity or two with you.

Johnny Mercer,One For My Baby (And One More For The Road) Lyrics,"
                    It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place except you and me
So set 'em up Joe, I've got a little story you oughta know
We're drinking my friend to the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road

I got the routine, so drop another nickel in the machine
I'm feeling so bad, I wish you'd make the music dreamy and sad
Could tell you a lot but that's not in a gentleman's code
Just make it one for my baby and one more for the road

You'd never know it but buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things to say
And when I'm gloomy, you simply got to listen to me
Until it's talked away

Well that's how it goes and Joe I know you're gettin' anxious to close
So thanks for the beer, I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear

I figure that it's engine number forty-nine
She's the only one that'll sound that way
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe

See the old smoke risin' 'round the bend
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend
Folks around these parts get the time of day
From the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe

Here she comes, woo oo woo oo woo oo woo oo woo woo
Hey Jim, you better get out the rig
Woo oo woo oo woo oo woo oo woo woo
She's got a list of passengers that's pretty big

And they'll all want lifts to Brown's Hotel
'Cause lots of them been travelin' for quite a spell

Johnny Mercer,Lulu's Back In Town Lyrics,"
                    Where's that careless chambermaid?
Where'd she put my razor blade?
She mislaid it, I'm afraid,
It's gotta be foun'!
Ask her when she cleaned my room
What she did with my perfume;
I just can't lose it,
I've gotta use it,
'Cause Lulu's back in town.

Gotta get my old tuxedo pressed,
Gotta sew a button on my vest,
'Cause tonight I've gotta look my best,
Lulu's back in town.
Gotta get a half a buck somewhere,
Gotta shine my shoes and slick my hair,
Gotta get myself a boutonniere,
Lulu's back in town.
You can tell all my pets,
All my Harlem coquettes;
Mister Otis regrets
That he won't be aroun'.
You can tell the mailman not to call,
I ain't comin' home until the fall,
And I might not get back home at all,
Lulu's back in town.

You can bet I've got it bad,
Best complaint I've ever had;
We'll be stepping out tonight,
An' struttin', an' how.
We're in for the swellest time,
Finish up without a dime;
Look here, you fellers,
I'll make you jealous,
My Lulu, she's a wow.

Gotta get my old tuxedo pressed,
Gotta sew a button on my vest,

Johnny Mercer,Love Is Just Around The Corner Lyrics,"
                    Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
Can't you see? Oh, you have captured me!
Being so glamorous, now can't you be amorous just with me,
Make it soon, Cop a look at that moon.

Love is just around the corner,
Any cozy little corner,
Love is just around the corner,
When I'm around you.

I'm a sentimental mourner,
And I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me on that corner,
Just waiting for you.

Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us,
You are cuter than Venus,
And what's more you've got arms!

Let's go cuddle in a corner,
Any cozy little corner,
Love is just around the corner,
And I'm around you.

Love is just around the corner,
Any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner,
When I'm around you.

I'm ten times as faithful,
As all your other men,
They all are true to no one but you,
But me I'm true to ten.

Oh, let's go cuddle in a cozy corner,
Any cozy little corner,
Love is just around the corner,
And I'm around you.

Johnny Mercer,Little Ol' Tune Lyrics,"
                    I know a friend of mine
And his business is writing songs
It's a kind of a gift and I get a big lift
From his melodies and diphthongs

We got to talk him once
I was curious as could be
To explain what to do, let him tell it to you
Just the way it was told to me

First you write a little ol' tune, real easy
Not as hard to play as let's say part cheesy
Real simple chords in the key of C
A melody you can groove

Next you add some little ol' words on to it
Try to get some people who'll sing to do it
Then if they say, “My have you got a hit”
You act non committal and say, “Just a little ol' tune”

Now record your little ol' tune, just hum it
Could you try to fancy it up? Far from it
Dub in some top tenor harmony
Just me, me, me, as you groove

Yes, next you sing a baritone part from way back
Add a zoom, zoom, bass and then start the playback
And when they say, “Ma, he's singing forte”
You act non committal and say, “Just a little ol' tune”
You act non committal and say, “Just a little, just a little ol' tune”                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/johnny+mercer/ + /j/johnny+mercer/little+ol+tune_20826560.html,1,0,i know a friend of mine and his business is writing songs it's a kind of a gift and i get a big lift from his melodies and diphthongs we got to talk him once i was curious as could be to explain what to do let him tell it to you just the way it was told to me first you write a little ol' tune real easy not as hard to play as let's say part cheesy real simple chords in the key of c a melody you can groove next you add some little ol' words on to it try to get some people who'll sing to do it then if they say my have you got a hit you act non committal and say just a little ol' tune now record your little ol' tune just hum it could you try to fancy it up far from it dub in some top tenor harmony just me me me as you groove yes next you sing a baritone part from way back add a zoom zoom bass and then start the playback and when they say ma he's singing forte you act non committal and say just a little ol' tune you act non committal and say just a little just a little ol' tune,i know a friend of mine and his business is writing songs it s a kind of a gift and i get a big lift from his melodies and diphthongs we got to talk him once i was curious as could be to explain what to do let him tell it to you just the way it was told to me first you write a little ol tune real easy not as hard to play as let s say part cheesy real simple chords in the key of c a melody you can groove next you add some little ol words on to it try to get some people who ll sing to do it then if they say my have you got a hit you act non committal and say just a little ol tune now record your little ol tune just hum it could you try to fancy it up far from it dub in some top tenor harmony just me me me as you groove yes next you sing a baritone part from way back add a zoom zoom bass and then start the playback and when they say ma he s singing forte you act non committal and say just a little ol tune you act non committal and say just a little just a little ol tune

                    Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way

Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh, hey

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

There's nothing new about jingle bells
In case you wanna know
There's a verse that your daddy sang
When he was mummy's boy

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side

The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot
What?

Bells, bells all the way
I don't know whose playing 'em bells
But I wish they'ed sound that way

Hey, bells, bells all the way
Oh listen to the very merry melody we play

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Talkin' bout jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun, what fun it is to ride

Johnny Mercer,Jamboree Jones Lyrics,"
                    I'll begin the story
Out in West Virginia
Is a little college
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

All the student body
Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it

Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch `em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

`Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)
And then the students all began to yell

The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.
Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still

Just as it always will
And there's a picture in the hall of fame
You'll find the boy in the frame who won the game

Johnny Mercer,It's Great To Be Alive Lyrics,"

And have your baby on your arm

In spite of bills
And other minor ills

To have a roof above
And watch the little ones around

Deductible dependents

To work from nine to five

And have a piece of land to farm

It's great to be alive
(It's up to work and strivin')
To have a car to drive
(Then take your girl to a drive-in)
And swing your baby on your arm
(To know that at five you're really arrivin', she'll be holding your arm)

In spite of bills
(Even though the bills just pile up by the million)
And other minor ills
(We manage to find the proper pills)
Somehow me manage to survive

To have a roof above

Johnny Mercer,Something's Gotta Give Lyrics,"
                    SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE
When an irresistible force such as you
Meets an old immovable object like me
You can bet as sure as you live
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give,
Something's gotta give.
When an irrepressible smile such as yours
Warms an old implacable heart such as mine
Don't say no because I insist.
Somewhere, somehow,
Someone's gonna be kissed.
So en garde who knows what the fates have in store
from their vast mysterious sky?
I'll try hard ignoring those lips I adore
but how long can anyone try?
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might,
Chances are some heavenly star spangled night
We'll find out as sure as we live
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give,
Something's gotta give.

Johnny Mercer,Strip Polka Lyrics,"
                    This is the strip polka
I adore this [incomprehensible]

[incomprehensible]

There's a burlesque theater where the gang loves to go
To see queenie the cutie of the burlesque show
And the thrill of the evening is when out queenie skips
And the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off, take it off"", cries a voice from the rear
""Take it off, take it off"", soon it's all you can hear
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops and always just in time

She's as fresh and as wholesome as the flowers in May
And she hopes to retire to the farm someday
But you can't buy a farm until you're up in the chips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off, take it off"", all the customers shout
""Down in front, down in front"", while the band beats it out
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops and always just in time

Queenie, queen of them all
Queenie, someday you'll fall
Someday church bells will chime
In strip polka time

Oh, she hates corny waltzes and she hates the gavotte
And there's one big advantage if the music's hot
It's a fast moving exit just in case something rips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

Drop around, take it in, it's the best in the west
""Take it off, take it off, take it off"", you can yell like the rest
Take her out when it's over, she's a peach when she's dressed
But she stops and always just in time, time, time

Queenie, queen of them all
Queenie, someday you'll fall
Someday church bells will chime

Johnny Mercer,Ace In The Hole Lyrics,"
                    This town is full of guys
Who think they’re mighty wise
Just because they know a thing or two

You’ll meet them, night and day
Strollin’ up and down Broadway
Telling of the wonders they can do

Oh, sing it, Bobby boy!
I just did

There’s con men and there’s boosters
There’s card sharks and crapshooters
They congregate around the Metropole

If I knew what that meant, I would agree with him
They wear flashy ties and collars
Yes, but where do they get their dollars?
They all have got an ace, down in the hole

Yes, and some of them write
To the old folks for coin
And that is their ace in the hole

And others have friends
On the old Tenderloin
That’s their old ace in the hole

Why, they’ll tell you of trips
That they’re going to make
From Florida to the North Pole

The fact is, their name would be 'Mud'
Just like a chum playin’ stud
If they lost that old ace in the hole

Oh yes, now, some of them write
You’ll find a lot of them write to the
  (Just a minute, just a minute)

Let the man play his piano solo
But I want to sing tenor
I don’t really care if you sing ten or twenty minutes
After he’s through playin’ piano

Listen to ‘em, I think I make it better than he does
Well, that’s the nastiest remark I’ve ever heard
Listen now, if you don’t like the way I sing
Why don’t you sing?
Sing 'Melancholy Baby', sing something!

Why, they tell you of the trips
They’re gonna make
Over Florida, all the way up to the North Pole
Oh, it’s sad, it's sad, Volare!

But their names would be mud
Like a chum playin’ stud

Johnny Mercer,A Huggin' And A Chalkin' Lyrics,"
                    I got a gal that's mighty sweet
With big blue eyes and tiny feet
Her name is Rosabelle Malone
And she tips the scale at twenty stone.

Oh, gee, but ain't it grand to have a girl so big and fat
That when you go to hug her, you don't know where you're at
You have to take a piece of chalk in your hand
And hug a ways and chalk a mark to see where you began

One day I was a-huggin' and a-chalkin' and a-chalkin' and a-huggin' away
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' around the other way over the mountain
Comin' around the other way

Oh Gee, it ain't so grand to be a girl so big and fat
That when you go to hug me you don't know where you're at

I have to take a piece of chalk in my hand
And hug away and chalk a mark to see where I began

Now where is that chalk? Ah, here it is
I'll put one cross here, and another one here.

Darling.

Ah, but seriously you know that I'm crazy about you, 
and I mean all of you, every little bit.

We both feel we're meant for each other.

Yet when we walk through the street people think 
that I'm out with my mother.

One day I was a-huggin' and a-chalkin' and a-beggin' her to be my bride
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' around the other side, It was Lou Praeger
Comin' around the other side.

If you wanna hear my story
The settle back and just sit tight
While I start reviewin'
The attitude of doin' right

Bring gloom down to the minimum

Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark
What did they do just when everything looked so dark?

And give you the big eye but when that sweet talk is done
A woman's a two faced, a woman's something
That would leave you singing the blues in the night""

Now the rain is falling, heaven can hear you calling
Doo wee, heaven blows the lonesome whistle
Blowing across the thresh hold, doo wee, doo wee ta too tee
A crickety crack go wickety wack the blues in the night

Evening breeze will start
Trees that crying in the
All in the world wood haunted slide
When you get the blues in the night

So take my word or the mocking bird
Will sing a sadder kind of song
Maybe he knows things
He knows things can go wrong

A match is a maybe love is the same job
Whenever the four winds blow, I've been to some big town
Had me some big town but there is one thing I know
A woman's a two faced a woman's something

Johnny Mercer,Bob White Lyrics,"
                    Just listen to the Bob White
He never could sing right
You should hip it to the latest sound
And the talk that's goin' 'round

Well, I was talking to the parakeet
And he said, ""Man, now about that beat""
(How about that beat?)
""Hey Bob White, ain't you gonna swing tonight?""

Several people heard the Albatross
(Yes)
Whisper Robin is on the sauce
(I know for a fact he's on the wagon)
Bob White, nothing but a neophyte
(John, what does that word mean?)
(Amateur)

Even the Pheasant found it unpleasant
Hearing you hit that flat note
Whereas the Sparrow froze to his marrow
When he heard that note

The opinion of the Tufted Grouse
Is you play to an empty house
(Could happen to anybody, sure could)
Get up, off that pair
Shape up, make it dare
Bob White, you gotta sing it out tonight

Take a letter to the Meadowlark
In reply to his rude remark
(Well, the mails must go through)
Bob White, invites you to a bash tonight
(My tux isn't even pressed)

Take a wire to the Nightingale
Tell him Bob ain't begun to wail
Bob White's gonna put him down for spite
(Circulate the word)

Call up the Catbird
Tell that old fat bird
He's gonna sing a storm up
Hip the Canary, it'll be scary
After the warm up

Man, he's even gonna gas the goose
He'll be a' looser than Dr. Seuss
(Wait a minute John, do I detect a note
Of meaning that he's gonna be 'right in tune?)
Man, I'm telling you, he's gonna be 'on the moon
(I see)

Bob White
He's gonna ball it up tonight
Oh, he's in there
Guy whistles pretty
Yeah, like a bird, what?

Here's a wire from the Albatross
(Sounds urgent)
It reads, 'Robin is still the boss'
(Well, thank you very much folks)
Bob White, he was in the groove tonight
(Ha ha ha)

I quote directly from the Whoopin' Crane
He says, ""Man, it was like insane""
(He made it plain)
Bob White really fought a groovy fight
I thought I had him dead in the third round

Hey, old poppa Red Bird
Who is the head bird
Says you were in there swingin'
(He was tryin')
Even the Jackdaw
Flew out the back door
Buckin' and wingin'

You instigated such a swingin' gig
That all them quadrapeds wanna dig
(Here, here, you mean)
Here come, the moose and elk
And there goes Lawrence Welk

You really sang it out tonight

Now that you got me made
Goodness, but I'm afraid
Somethin's gonna happen to you

Listen, big boy
You gotta be hooked, and how
I would die if I should lose you now

Button up your overcoat
When the wind is free
Take good care of yourself
You belong to me

Eat an apple every day
Get to bed by three
Oh, take good care of yourself
You belong to me

Be careful crossing streets, ooh, ooh
Cut out sweets, ooh, ooh
Lay off meat, ooh, ooh
You'll get a pain and ruin your tum-tum

Wear your flannel underwear
When you climb a tree
Oh, take good care of yourself
You belong to me

Button up your overcoat
When the wind is free
Oh, take good care of yourself
You belong to me
Boop-boop-a-doop

When you sass a traffic cop
Use diplomacy
Just take good care of yourself
You belong to me

Beware of frozen funds, ooh, ooh
Stocks and bonds, ooh, ooh

Lion King,We Are One Lyrics,"
                    As you go through life you'll see
There is so much that we
Don't understand

And the only thing we know
Is things don't always go
The way we planned

But you'll see every day
That we'll never turn away
When it seems all your dreams come undone

We will stand by your side
Filled with hope and filled with pride
We are more than we are
We are one

If there's so much I must be
Can I still just be me
The way I am?

Can I trust in my own heart
Or am I just one part
Of some big  plan?

Even those who are gone
Are with us as we go on
Your journey has only begun

Tears of pain, tears of joy
One thing nothing can destroy
Is our pride, deep inside
We are one

We are one, you and I
We are like the earth and sky
One family under the sun

All the wisdom to lead
All the courage that you need
You will find when you see

Lion King,I Cant Wait To Be King Lyrics,"
                    I'm gonna be a mighty king so enemys beware
(Well I've never seen a king or beast with quiet so little hair)
I'm gonna be the main event like no king was before, 
I'm brushin up, I'm lookin down, I'm workin on my ROAR! 
(A thus far rather an uninspiring thing)
Oh, I just can't wait to be KING! 
(Well u have a long way to go young master if u think...)
No one sayin do this... (now when I said that)
No one sayin be there... (now what I meant was...)
No one sayin stop that... (now what u don't realize...)
No one sayin see here... (NOW SEE HERE!...)
Free to run around all day(well that's defenitly out of the...)
Free to do it all my way! 

I think it's time that u and I arranged a heart to heart
Kings don't need advise from little hornbills for a start
If this is where the monarcy is headed count me out
Out of service, out of afria, I wouldn't hang about
This child is getting wildly out of wing
Oh I just can't wait to be KING! 

Everybody look left, 
Everybody look right, every where you look I'm
Standin spot light(not yet)

Lets hear it on the heard and on the wing, 
It's gonna be king simbas finest fling)

A littel cooling breeze, a lil pagent green,

And il be snoozin in my hamock by a ripplin stream,
Many miles from any tunnel and the digging team,
Lookin out for number one will be my only dream,
That's all I want, that's all I need.

Lion King,Love Will Find A Way Lyrics,"
                    In a perfect world
One we've never known
We would never need
To face the world alone
They can have the world
We'll create our own
I may not be brave or strong or smart
But somewhere in my secret heart I know

Love will find a way
Anywhere I go
I'm home, if you are there beside me
Like dark turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way

I was so afraid
Now I realize
Love is never wrong
And so it never dies
There's a perfect world
Shining in your eyes

And if only they could feel it too
The happiness I feel with you they'll know

Love will find a way
Anywhere we go
We're home
If we are there together
Like dark turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way
I know

Lion King,Not One Of Us Lyrics,"
                    Deception
Disgrace
Evil as plain as the scar on his face

Deception (An outrage!)
Disgrace (For shame!)
He asked for trouble the moment he came

Deception (An outrage!)
(He can't change his stripes)
Disgrace (For shame!)
(You know these Outsider types)
He asked for trouble the moment he came
(See you later, agitator!)
Deception (An outrage!)
(Just leave us alone!)
Disgrace (For shame!)
(Traitor, go back with your own!)
He asked for trouble the moment he came
(See you later, agitator!)

Born in grief
Raised in hate
Helpless to defy his fate
Let him run
Let him live
But do not forget what we cannot forgive

And he is not one of us
He has never been one of us
He is not part of us
Not our kind

Someone once lied to us
Now we're not so blind
For we knew he would do what he's done
And we know that he'll never be one of us

He is not one of us

Lion King,I've Got A Lovely Bunch Of Coconuts Lyrics,"
                    Down at an english fair one evening I was there
When I heard a showman shouting underneath the flair

I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts
There they are all standing in a row
Big ones, small ones, some as big as your head
Give them a twist a flick of the wrist
That's what the showman said
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts
Every ball you throw will make me rich
There stands my wife, the idol of me life
Singing roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch
Roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch
Roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch
Roll a bowl a ball, roll a bowl a ball
Singing roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts (they're lovely)
There they are all standing in a row (one, two, three, four)
Big ones, small ones, some as big as your head (and bigger)
Give them a twist a flick of the wrist
That's what the showman said
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts
Every ball you throw will make me rich
There stands my wife, the idol of me life
Singing roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch (all together now)
Roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch (harmony)
Roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch
Roll a bowl a ball, roll a bowl a ball

Two courses handed to us on a plate
We'll have you raw, won't be long to wait
Seeing you're already brown
Chow down!

Your ribs are looking so tasty

Such chewy little chops, chums

Eat up!

Now wasn't it her mom who ate your dad?

And having parents eaten makes us mad

We're gonna settle up the score a tad

Hey, did we order this dinner to go?

Pumba-
What!
Timon-
.. And they don't have a clue..
Pumba-
Who!
Timon-
.. They'll fall in love and heres the bottom line.. Our trios down to two
Pumba-
Oh..

Timon-
The sweet caress of twilight
Theres magic, everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disasters in the air!!!

[Chorus:]-
Can you feel, the love tonight...
The peace the evening brings
The world for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things.

Simba-
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see.
The truth about my past.. Impossible!
She'd turn away from me..

Nala-
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what I can't decide.
Why wont he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside......

[Chorus:]-
Can you feel, the love tonight
The peace the evening brings
The world for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

Can you feel the love tonight
You need'nt look too far
Stealing through, the nights uncertanies

Lion King,Can You Feel The Love Tonight Lyrics,"
                    There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you
And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors

Lion King,Be Prepared Lyrics,"
                    I never thought hyenas essential
They're crude and unspeakably plain
But maybe they've a glimmer of potential
If allied to my visishiton and brain

I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are, pay attention
My words are a matter of pride

It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares

So prepare for a chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer

And where do we feature?

Just listen to teacher
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues!
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!

Yeah! Be prepared. We'll be prepared! For what?

For the death of the king

Is he sick?

No, fool! We're going to kill him. And Simba, too

Great idea! Who needs a king?

No king, no king! La la la la la!

Idiots! There will be a king!

But you said...

I will be king! Stick with me and you'll never go hungry again!

Yay, all right! Long live the king!
Long live the king!

It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored

Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!

So prepare for the coup of the century
Be prepared for the murkiest scamoooooo, la-la-la!
Meticulous planningwe'll have food!
Tenacity spanninglots of food
Decades of denialwe repeat
Is simply why I'llendless meat
Be king undisputed
Respected, saluted
And seen for the wonder I am
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!

Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared -

Lion King,The Madness Of King Scar Lyrics,"
                    Zazu, why am I not loved?
I am that rare and awesome thing
I'm every inch a king
Yet I feel a twinge of doubt
As I go walk about

Hey, boss!

When my name is whispered through the pride
Is this talk of love or regicide?

Reggie who?

Tell me I'm adored
Please tell me I'm adored

Hey, boss!

Oh, what is it?

We got a bone to pick with you

There's no food, no water--

Yeah. It's dinnertime, and there ain't no
Stinkin' entrйes!

Oh, you and your petty complaints. You don't know what real hunger is.
Day after day it gnaws at the very core of my being

I had that once. It was worms

No, no, no... It's like an itch... Deep, persistent, profound...

That's it-- worms! When they get really bad all you gotta do is... Hunker
Down and scoot

Thanks for the tip. Ingrates! If it weren't for me you'd be beating off
Buzzards for your next bite!

Yeah, you're our savior, thanks a bunch
But how about some lunch?
It doesn't matter if it's fresh
I need a fix of flesh
My bones have moved to where they've never been
They are on the outside looking in

Are you blaming me?

Oh no, it's the lionesses

You are so adored
Oh, you are so adored

That's more like it

But what I'd give for one more hit
Of wildebeest kielbasa
Or maybe hornbill on the spit...

Oh, how I miss Mufasa

Mufasa?! Mufasa?! How dare you! I told you never to mention that name!

Note taken. I shall never mention ""M-m-m"" again

Even in death, his shadow looms over me
There he is!
No! There he is!
And there!

Calm yourself, Sire, or you'll get another one of your splitting
Headaches!

I am perfectly fine!
I'm better than Mufasa was
I'm revered
I am reviled
I'm idolized
I am despised
I'm keeping calm
I'm going wild!

I tell myself I'm fine
Yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am, no you're not
I tell myself I'm fine

No you're not, yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am
No you're not
Yes, no, yes, no, who am I talking to...?

Oh, pull yourself together, Sire!

Oh, very well. Zazu? Zazu, Zazu, Zazu...?

Yes, Sire?

Nobody loved me, there's the rub, not even as a cub
What did my brother have that I don't have?

Do you want the short list or the long?

Whatever!

Well, he had adoring subjects... A loving family... A devoted queen...

That's it! I need a queen!

A what?

A queen, man! A queen! Without a queen, what am I? A dead end, no line, no
Descendants, no future. With a queen, I'll have cubs... Immortality will
Be mine! Immortality will be mine!

Scar

Ah, Nala... Your timing couldn't have been more perfect. My how you've
Grown

Scar, you have got to do something. We're being forced to overhunt

She's got those assets feminine

You're the king. Control the hyenas

I have to make her mine

You're destroying the Pridelands

Nobility in every gene

If we don't stop now.. Don't you see...

She has to be my queen

... There's still a chance for things to be all right again...

Come, sweet Nala
It's written in the stars

What are you doing? Are you listening to me?

We'll create a host of little Scars

What are you talking about?

Tell me I'm adored

Get away from me

Tell me I'm adored
Oh, Nala... You know how I loathe violence... One way or another, you will
Be mine

Never, Scar. Never!

Lion King,The Morning Report Lyrics,"
                    It's an honor and a privilege, a duty I perform
With due sense of decorum and with pride
With deference and great respect very much the norm
Plus a hint of sycophancy on the side
To lay before my ruler all the facts about his realm
To fill him in on all the beastly news

Yes, yes, Zazu, get on with it!

In order that His Majesty stands sturdy at the helm
Aware of all the fauna's latest views

Zazu! The morning report!

Er-- yes, Sire-- the morning report

Chimps are going ape, giraffes remain above it all
Elephants remember, though just what I can't recall
Crocodiles are snapping up fresh offers from the banks
Showed interest in my nest egg but I quickly said ""No thanks!""
We haven't paid the hornbills and the vultures have a hunch
Not everyone invited will be coming back for lunch

This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report

What are you doing, son?

Pouncing

Let and old pro show you how it's done

The buffalo have got a beef
About this season's grassstay low to the ground
Warthogs have been thwarted
In attempts to save their gas
Flamingoes in the pink andyeah, stay low!
Chasing secretary birds
Saffron is this season's color
Seen in all the herdsshh, not a sound
Moving down the rank and filetake it slow
To near the bottom rungone more step
Far too many beetles are
Quite frankly in the dungthen pounce!
Aaaaaak!

This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort

Just waiting to hear your voice
One word, just a word will do

I just don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad.)

Isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything?
Look at this trove
Treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Looking around here you think
Sure, she's got everything
I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs?
I've got twenty!
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more

I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see them dancin'
Walking around on those - what do you call 'em?
Oh - feet!

Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a - what's that word again?
Street

Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free - wish I could be
Part of that world

What would I give if I could live out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
Bet'cha on land they understand,
bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women sick of swimmin'
Ready to stand

I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it - what's the word?
Burn?

When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be

Little Mermaid,Mysterious Fathoms Below Lyrics,"
                    Sailors:
Heave ho, heave ho
I'll tell you a tale of the bottomless blue
And it's hey to the starboard, heave-ho
Brave sailor beware, for a big 'un's a-brewin'
Mysterious fathoms below
Heave-ho, heave-ho
I'll sing you a song of the king of the sea
And it's hey to the starboard, heave-ho
The ruler of all of the ocean is he
In mysterious fathoms below
Fathoms below, below
From whence wayward westerlies blow
Where Triton is king and his merpeople sing
In mysterious fathoms below

Eric:
Isn't this great?

Grimsby:
Oh yes, delightful.

Eric:
The salty sea air, the wind blowing in your face, I
Love it!

Grimsby:
You love it?  I'm about to heave-ho myself!

Sailors:
Heave-ho, heave-ho
I'll tell you a tale of the bottomless blue
And it's hey to the starboard, heave-ho
Look out, lad, a mermaid be waiting for you
In mysterious fathoms below

Grimsby:
Eric, please!  Get your royal keister down from there!

Eric:
Oh, Grim, nothing's going to...  Woah!

Grimsby:
Eric, Eric!  It is not at all princely...  Oh, I loathe storms!

Sailor:
Ha!  This ain't no storm.  That's a storm!  Way out there...

The king of the ocean is angry
So trouble's a-brewin' out there
I'm tellin' you, lad, when King Triton is mad
How the waves'll buck, rock to and fro
Hold on, good luck, as down you go

Sailors:
For Triton is king of the bottomless blue
And it's hey to the starboard, heave-ho
Beware of the magic his merpeople do
In mysterious fathoms below
Heave-ho, heave-ho

Eric:
Who are they singing about, sailor?  Who is King Triton?

Sailor:
Why, ruler of the merpeople, lad!  And a powerful lord is he!

Eric:
The merpeople?

Sailor:
Aye, and they's lives down there,
With the bodies of fish and the rest of 'em human!
Yes, it's what fifty years at sea will do to you.

Little Mermaid,The Sound Of Laughter Lyrics,"
                    Ariel, I'm so confused
I tell joke you're not amused
Given a choice I know you'll choose
The sound of laughter

All the creatures in the sea
Fish by fish they all agree
'Tis no sweeter harmony
Than the sound of laughter

Cos the giggle and chuckle and ha-ha-ha
Only make the fun come faster
Cos the giggle and chuckle and ha-ha-ha
Tis a phrase any mermaid can muster
That's the sound of laughter

Like the pounding ocean beat
It's the common tongue we speak
'Tis the rhythm that makes life complete
The sound of laughter

Stop the quiet undue peace
This serious stuff shall now cease
With the wonderful release
Of the sound of laughter

Cos the giggle and chuckle and ha-ha-ha
Only make the fun come faster
Cos the giggle and chuckle and ha-ha-ha
Tis a phrase any mermaid can muster
Oh, the sound of laughter

Cos the giggle and chuckle and ha-ha-ha

All snooze in the sea, how sweetly they snore

Little Mermaid,You Got To Be You Lyrics,"
                    When I was but a schoolboy
I dreamed I would grow tall
And man, it made me crabby
That a crab could be so small

With this I tell my teacher
She say, ""But don't you see?
Each and every creature
Is exactly how they should be""

She said we all are special
From jellyfish to king
We all do different things
And with that she start to sing

You got to be you
I got to be me
It's simple but true
What else could you do
Who else could you be

You got your own style
Now let it come through
And remember no matter what
You got to be you

Skatefish got to skate
Stingrays got to sting
Catfish got to purr
And Sebastian got to sing
Seahorse got to ride
Flounder got to play
And whale got to make the trouble
All the livelong say

So why should you be gloomy
That you're too big or small
The sea is very roomy
And there's plenty room for us all

You heard my little story
Now let it be your guide
Just treat yourself with pride
You'll be more than satisfied

You got to be you
I got to be me
I'll try to be clearer
Look in the mirror
What do you see?

You see what I mean
Now let us review

Let's see now...
Some may be tiny
Some got the claws
Gills may be shiny
Sharks got the jaws
Down in the briny
Those are the laws
And that is why we sing

You got to be you
I got to be me
It's simple but true
What else could you do
Who else could you be

You got your own style
Now let it come through
And remember no matter what
You got to be you

You got your own voice
You've got to rejoice
You got to be you

Little Mermaid,Poor Unfortunate Souls Lyrics,"
                    URSULA
The only way to get what you want is
To become a human yourself.

ARIEL
Can you do that?

URSULA
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.
It's what I live for.
To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself.
Poor souls with no one else to turn to.

I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
True? Yes!
And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And here lately, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed (pathetic)

Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, ""Spells, Ursula, please!""
And I help them!
Yes I do

Now it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls

Have we got a deal?

ARIEL
If I become human,
I'll never be with my father or sisters again.

URSULA
That's right...
But you'll have your man, heh heh.
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it? Heh heh.
Oh, and there is one more thing.
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.
You can't get something for nothing, you know!

ARIEL
But I don't have any-

URSULA
I'm not asking much, just a token really, a trifle!
You'll never even miss it...
What I want from you is - your voice.

ARIEL
My voice?

URSULA
You've got it, Sweet-cakes, 
No more talking, singing, ZIP!

ARIEL
But without my voice, how can I-

URSULA
You'll have your looks, your pretty face!
And don't underestimate the importance of body language, ha!

The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore!
Yes on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word
And after all dear, what is idle prattle for?
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who get's her man

Come on you poor unfortunate soul,
Go ahead!
Make your choice!
I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
Ya' poor unfortunate soul
It's sad but true!
If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet,
You've got the pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her boys
The boss is on a roll
This poor unfortunate soul!

Beluga sevruga
Come winds of the Caspian Sea
Larengix glaucitis
Et max laryngitis
La volce to me

Now, sing!

ARIEL
Ah-Ah-Ah~

Keep singing!

Little Mermaid,Silence Is Golden Lyrics,"
                    You won't sing, you won't speak
Not a word, not a sqeak
Not a peep, not a squeal
That's the price, love, that's the deal

But silence, silence is golden my dear
Up there they hate chatter
So what does it matter
If you become mute (nobody likes a loudmouth!)

I mean it
Silence, silence is golden my dear
Don't you think you should try it
They'll say ""she's so quiet, so shy and so cute!""

Well, take it or leave it, that's all, that's the bargain
Go on, take a stand, make a choice
Remeber you'll get the legs and the lungs and the prince
All I get is the voice

And you'll be
Silent, but silence is golden, sign here
There's no choice for you since
You're in love with a prince
But relax, I've been told

Everytime they look at me?

I don't know why I scare the herring
I'm so lonely, sad and blue
What's a monster to do?

Sing a new song

So come out of your shell
And get into the swim
There's a wonderful world
Waiting for you to jump in

Just say goodbye to the dark and gloomy
Come outside where it's bright and roomy
Try your smile on someone new
And watch what it can do

Beware barracudas, drop to your knee
Defending our friends and enemies
As big as a whale but with a much smaller tail

Facing the foe with our fearless wit
Daring the dastards to put up their dukes
Great gobs of gore, we'll storm the shore
And seek the unknown, then can we go home?

We'll clobber those crabs with their clammy claws
We'll sever those sharks with their savage jaws
The battle is fierce and mercifully brief
Because they're heroes they return as kings of the reef

Dine with the best, dressed with a flair
Climbed every mountain because it's there
Come on, follow me, we'll make history
To courage, to us, I'll try it, you're bust!

Little Mermaid,Under The Sea Lyrics,"
                    The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?

Under the sea, under the sea
Darling it's better down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we're devoting full time to floating
Under the sea, ha ha...

Down here all the fish is happy
And soft through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad 'cause they in the bowl!
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who goin' be on the plate?

Wo-no, under the sea
Under the sea
Nobody beat us, fry us and eat us
In frickazee
We what the land folks loves to cook
Under the sea we off the hook
We've got no troubles, life is the bubbles
Under the sea (under the sea)
Under the sea (under the sea)
Since life is sweet here, we got the beat here
Naturally (naturally-ee-ee-ee)
Even the sturgeon and the ray
They get the urge and start to play
We've got the spirit, you've got to hear it
Under the sea

The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass and they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul (yeah)
The ray, he can play the Ling's on the strings
The trout rockin out
The blackfish she sings
The Stout and the Sprat
They know where it's at
They know that blowfish blow!

Yeah, under the sea
Under the sea
When the sardine begin to beguine
It's music to me (music is to me)
What do they got, a lot of sand?
We've got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here know how to jam here
Under the sea
Each little slug here cutting a rug here
Under the sea
Each little snail know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter under the water

Well dear friend, it's time to put this letter into a bottle. And hope the ocean current brings it back to you. Maybe soon you'll come to visit me, even if only in your dreams. Just follow the mermaid song and you'll find me. Til then, your friend, Ariel.

[ Mermaids ]

Come to the place where mermaids dwell
Follow the call of trumpet shells
We'll fill your sails with friendly winds
And point the way with shining fins
And you can bid your cares farewell

Come to the place where mermaids dwell
In dreams you know the way so well
For if you hope and you believe
You'll see the golden nets we weave
You'll hear the stories that we tell
Where mermaids dwell
(Where mermaids dwell)
Where mermaids dwell
(Where mermaids dwell)

There are dolphins to ride for pleasure
And starfish that twinkle all night long
Streams of pearls and sunken treasure
And a mermaid song

Come to the place where mermaids dwell
Where shimmering ocean waters swell
Where laughing children of the waves
Play hide and seek among the caves
And ride a seahorse carousel

Come to the place where mermaids dwell
(Come to the place where mermaids dwell)
In dreams you know the way so well
For if you hope and you believe
You'll see the golden nets we weave
You'll hear the magic in our spell

Little Mermaid,In My Blue Backyard Lyrics,"
                    On Saturday morning I'm up at the break of the waves
Right through my window a big world of water awaits
To have a sea at your fintips is such a special treat
I take a few steps out the back of my house for all the fun I need

In my blue backyard
It's open and wide and blue as the sky
In my blue backyard
There's no garden to hoe
No seaweeds to mow
Just fine fin friends who love to play
Dolphins to ride, bubbles to chase
Deep in the heart of my blue backyard

Whenever I'm swimming I know I won't see a fence
Out here there's no boundaries except for the continents
The seals and eels and humpbacks, the squid and pompaloo?
Are some of my pals who'll be hanging around so I won't be alone

In my blue backyard
It's open and wide and blue as the sky
In my blue backyard
There's no garden to hoe
No seaweeds to mow
Just fine fin friends who love to play
Dolphins to ride, bubbles to chase
Deep in the heart of my blue backyard

Sometimes I hide in the coral beds that's where I go to think
I don't have to be inside 'til the sun starts to sink

Little Mermaid,Les Poissons Lyrics,"
                    Pierre
Les poissons, les poissons
How I love les poissons
Love to chop and to serve little fish
First I cut off their heads
Then I pull out their bones
Ah mes oui, savez toujours delice

Les poissons, les poissons
Hee hee hee, haw haw haw
With a cleaver I hack them in two
I pull out what's inside
And I serve it up fried
God, I love little fishes, don't you?

Here's something for tempting the palette
Prepared in the classic technique
First you pound the fish flat with a malette
Then you slash off their skin
Give their belly a slice
Then you rub some salt in
'Cause it makes it taste nice

Zoot alors, I have missed one!

Sacre bleu, what is this?
How on earth could I miss
Such a sweet little succulent crab
Quel Domage, what a loss
Here we go, in the sauce
Now some flour I think just a dab
Now I stuff you with bread
It don't hurt, 'cause you're dead!
And you're certainly lucky you are
'Cause it's gonna be hot in my big silver pot!
Tout-aloo mon poisson

Little Mermaid,At The Mermaid's Ball Lyrics,"
                    At the ball I'll dance like never before
Spinning up and down and round on the floor
When the music plays it's so entrancing
At the mermaid's ball when I go dancing

It's a lovely night, the seabreezes flow
Dancing by the light of starfish a-glow
Dreaming I'm in love, it's so enchanting
At the mermaid's ball when I go dancing

Pretty mermaids wearing seaflowers
Of green and pink and blue
Whirling round and round in circles
With their partners two by two

As the grand orchestra plays
Romantic songs of yesterday
We will dance the night away

Dreaming I'm in love, it's so entrancing
At the mermaid's ball when I go dancing
At the mermaid's ball when I go dancing

Little Mermaid,Beddie-Bye Blues Lyrics,"

Or I'll fill 'em full of slugs
That's an offer that you can't refuse
Forget your troubles and dream
Up a bubble-brained scheme

Shut your snappers and snooze
(Shut your snappers and snooze)
To the beddie-bye blues

Snuff out your cigars
And thank your lucky stars
You ain't swimming in some cement shoes
Think of something that's nice
(Like what, boss?)
Like a holdup or a heist (That's nice)
And take your getaway cruise
(Take your getaway cruise)
With the beddie-bye blues

Slip into slumber
Saw a little lumber and snore
Let 'em hear you on shore
Just cut a couple kippers
Relax your weary flippers
And don't forget to zip
Your little lips with zippers

And don't go crying for your muddah

Little Mermaid,Daring To Dance Lyrics,"
                    Who says that my dreams
Have to stay just my dreams
Oh, to dance would be grander than grand
With those what-sa-called slipper
Fit on my flipper
Could I twirl like they twirl up on land?

I'd dance night and day
To what they say is ballet
In a whoozit that's not too-too tight
I wish I hope I might

Find something inside
To show me how I can start
Living the songs
The songs I sing in my heart

Dreaming my dream
Dancing my dance
I've gotta try without wondering why
I must take a chance
Something inside
Is daring to dance

:::: Later::::

Listen closely you'll hear
Music dance in your ears
Look, a song you can see with your eyes
We're all in the sea
With our own way to be
But we'll never know 'til we try

Cause it's more than the voice that's singing the song
It's more than the tail that can dance
That'll make our dreams come true

It's something inside
That tells you how you can start
Living the song
The songs you sing in your heart

Dreaming your dream
Dancing your dance
Gotta try without wondering why
We must take a chance

Clap with the claws
Open the jaws and sing
This is the life
This is the life
Music and partying

When I was a young crustacean
Some days had their own frustrations
I follow along and sing the same old song
One day I had the notion
That I could compose an ocean
So I took command
And now I'm leader of the band

This is the life
This is the life
Don't be such a clam
Open up and jam

I'm older and yes, much wiser
An undersea enterpriser
This crab's in his prime
Is young enough to be having a good time

This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
Don't be such a clam
Open up and jam

This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
Come on out of your shell
Let the music do it's spell

Little Mermaid,Down To The Sea Lyrics,"

You are my world my darling
What a wonderful world I see
You are the song I'm singing
You're my beautiful Melody...

Eric: Darling, We better be going
Ariel: Look at her isn't she glowing?
Eric: She looks divine, and you look exquisite, but look at the time
Ariel: Couldn't be is it?

The crew is awaiting your orders
We're sailing away from the borders
Steady boy steady
Ahoy there, they're coming!
Trumpeters ready, drummers start drumming

Down to the sea we go
Down to a world I know
There's never been
Not ever before
A child born of sea and shore

Down to the sea we go
Down to the world below
A journey to bless
A princess to be
Under the sun, and under the sea...

Under the Sea: Ariel is coming (repeated very often)
What's all the big commotion
That's spreading through the ocean
From sea to shining sea
There is no hesitating
Today we're celebrating
Ariel's Melody

Lad-da-di-da ( repeated very often )
Today when Triton's daughter
Comes back here to the water
We're gonna have a spree
The boat is nearer now
I think I hear her now
Ariel's Melody

Merpeople:
Up from the sea we rise
Up to the world of skies
There's never been
Not ever before
A child born of sea and shore

Up from the sea we rise
Up to the world of skies
Forever to be
Together as one
Under the sea...
And under the sun...

Ariel:
This is your world my darling
One world the land and sea
My hope for you for always
Is that your heart will part of me
Down to the sea we go
Down to the world we know
Together we come
Forever to be

Even the whales are wailing
They're swimming fancy-free

Move your fins and move your feet
Life is sweet, life is grand
Though we rhumba with the bass brass brand

Little Mermaid,Home Is Lyrics,"
                    Home is
A place of warmth and wonder
Home is
The sea and all that's
Underneath the waves
We splash and play
Where angelfish roam
And sometimes being

Home is
A funny Flounder swimming
Home is
A group of guppies grinning
Floating by
Below the tide
You're never alone

When you look around and see a friendly fin
It's home
Wishin' on a starfish in the sand
Or being in a private place
That's all your own
Home's an underwater wonderland
You're always welcome

Home is
A feeling deep inside you
Home is
Your heart will always guide you
There again, to all your friends
Anywhere you roam

For home is love
And love is always home
Love is always home
Love is always home...

Little Mermaid,In Harmony Lyrics,"
                    What makes someone special?
I suppose it all depends
It's what's unique in each of us
That we all share as friends

The difference is our differences
Maybe smaller great
Variety add spice to life
So we should celebrate

In harmony
Harmony
You're you, I'm me
Together we
Can live in harmony

If there was only one note
How boring life would be
I'm glad there are so many notes
In many different keys

I hear each voice singing
With a special quality
And when we sing together we
Bring music to the sea

In harmony
Harmony
You're you, I'm me
Together we
Can live in harmony

Little Mermaid,Just A Little Love Lyrics,"
                    Poor little frightened baby (Flounder: Baby?)
Wandering on your own
You've been through a lot
Haven't you, Spot?

Ariel: Poor Spot, where's your mother, where's your family?

Everyone needs a family
No one should be alone
Now Flounder and me
We're gonna be
The family you've never known

Ariel: We have to take him home with us.
Flounder: We have to - what?!
Ariel: Oh, Flounder, can't you see?

Just a little love
And he'll be good as new
In just a little while
Watch a smile come shining through

He's just a little scared
He needs a friend today
He needs a little love
How can I turn away?

Ariel: He's singing! He sounds just like you!
Flounder: Kinda.
Ariel: See, he likes you! You'll be his big brother.
Flounder: I don't want to be his big brother! I don't want to be his midnight snack, either. It won't work, Ariel!
Ariel: Yes, it will.

Just a little love
That's how you begin
Showing him you care
Being there to tuck him in

Helping him to grow
Each and every day

Percussion, strings, winds, words

There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's something about her
And you don't know why, but you're dying to try
You wanna kiss the girl

Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know you do
Possible she want you too
There is one way to ask her
It don't take a word, not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl

Sing with me now

Sha-la-la-la-la-la my oh my
Look like the boy too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha-la-la-la-la-la ain't it sad
Ain't it a shame, too bad
He gonna miss the girl

Now's your moment
Floating in the blue lagoon
Boy, you better do it soon
No time will be better
She don't say a word
And she won't say a word
Until you kiss the girl

Sha-la-la-la-la-la don't be scared
You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl
Sha-la-la-la-la-la don't stop now
Don't try to hide it, how?

Little Mermaid,For A Moment Lyrics,"
                    Okay, get a grip, get a hang of this flipper
It's like slipping two feet into one big huge slipper.
This way is left which way is right
Oh, now I'll be circling in in circles all night

Oh, so this is forward. No problem.

I can't believe I can do this and more
To swim in the sea like I walk on the shore
Out of my shell, not closed up like a clam
look out sea, this is me, here I am

For a moment all of me
Is alive and at home in the sea
I'm swirling and twirling, so graceful and grand
Not stubbing my toes getting stuck in the sand

For a moment life is cool
I'm a splash in the world's biggest pool
This is more than my thoughts ever thought it could be
For a moment, just a moment, lucky me

If only for one moment
I have shared with you all I know
The sea wouldn't be a mystery
But why did you have to go?

Everything's newer, and brighter and bluer
And truer to life than before
Watch me soar

For a moment I can shine
Got a grin and a fin, it works fine
My fingers are wrinkly, I really don't care
If all my curls are curled out of my hair

For a moment I can feel
All the dreams I've been dreaming are real
Wish my mother could hear it, the sea is my song
For a moment, just a moment, I belong

I will find you my darling
And the moment that I do
I'll hold you close, my Melody
And sing the song of the sea with you

Sing the song of the sea with you
For a moment, just a moment, I belong                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/the+little+mermaid/ + /t/the+little+mermaid/for+a+moment_20627888.html,0,1,okay get a grip get a hang of this flipper it's like slipping two feet into one big huge slipper this way is left which way is right oh now i'll be circling in in circles all night oh so this is forward no problem i can't believe i can do this and more to swim in the sea like i walk on the shore out of my shell not closed up like a clam look out sea this is me here i am for a moment all of me is alive and at home in the sea i'm swirling and twirling so graceful and grand not stubbing my toes getting stuck in the sand for a moment life is cool i'm a splash in the world's biggest pool this is more than my thoughts ever thought it could be for a moment just a moment lucky me if only for one moment i have shared with you all i know the sea wouldn't be a mystery but why did you have to go everything's newer and brighter and bluer and truer to life than before watch me soar for a moment i can shine got a grin and a fin it works fine my fingers are wrinkly i really don't care if all my curls are curled out of my hair for a moment i can feel all the dreams i've been dreaming are real wish my mother could hear it the sea is my song for a moment just a moment i belong i will find you my darling and the moment that i do i'll hold you close my melody and sing the song of the sea with you sing the song of the sea with you for a moment just a moment i belong,okay get a grip get a hang of this flipper it s like slipping two feet into one big huge slipper this way is left which way is right oh now i ll be circling in in circles all night oh so this is forward no problem i can t believe i can do this and more to swim in the sea like i walk on the shore out of my shell not closed up like a clam look out sea this is me here i am for a moment all of me is alive and at home in the sea i m swirling and twirling so graceful and grand not stubbing my toes getting stuck in the sand for a moment life is cool i m a splash in the world s biggest pool this is more than my thoughts ever thought it could be for a moment just a moment lucky me if only for one moment i have shared with you all i know the sea wouldn t be a mystery but why did you have to go everything s newer and brighter and bluer and truer to life than before watch me soar for a moment i can shine got a grin and a fin it works fine my fingers are wrinkly i really don t care if all my curls are curled out of my hair for a moment i can feel all the dreams i ve been dreaming are real wish my mother could hear it the sea is my song for a moment just a moment i belong i will find you my darling and the moment that i do i ll hold you close my melody and sing the song of the sea with you sing the song of the sea with you for a moment just a moment i belong

You know who's in command

I keep a potion in my purse

No, you wouldn't want to mess with me

Take a barracuda's nose
And a dozen turtle toes
And the venom of a sea anemone
Eye of urchin, Crab of louie
Stir the goop until it's goey
That's my favourite rancid recipe
No, you wouldn't want to mess with me

Make way, I'm in charge
Your fate is looming large
It won't do you any good to flee
My concoctions never fail
So you'd better watch your tail

When you think I'm on the brink of going under
I've a way of coming out on top
Oh my darling debutante
I always get just want I want
And I want this mucky luck to stop!

I'm the mistress of mystique
With a slender slim physique
I'm an idol in the sea of infamy
I admit I'm quite a catch

Mulan,A Girl Worth Fighting For Lyrics,"
                    For a long time we've,
Been marching off to battle.

In our thundering herd,
We feel a lot like cattle.

Like the pounding beat
Our aching feet aren't easy to ignore

Hey! Think of instead,
A girl worth fighting for

Huh?

That's what I said,
A girl worth fighting for...
I want her paler than the moon,
With eyes that shine like stars

My girl will marvel at my strength,
Adore my battle scars.

I couldn't care less what she'll wear or what she looks like.
It all depends on what she cooks like.
Beef, pork, chicken.
Mmm

Bet the local girls thought you were quite the charmer.

And I'll bet the ladies love a man in armor.

You can guess what we
Have missed the most
Since we went off to war!
What do we want?
A girl worth fighting for.

My girl will think I have no faults.

That I'm a major find.

Uhh, How 'bout a girl who's got a brain,
Who always speaks her mind?

Nah!

My manly ways and turn of phrase are sure to thrill her!

He thinks he's such a lady killer.

I've a girl back home,
Who's unlike any other.

Yeah, the only girl who'd love him is his mother.

But when we come home in victory,
They'll line up at the door
What do we want?
A girl worth fighting for.
Wish that I had...
A girl worth fighting for.

Mulan,Reflection Lyrics,"
                    Look at me,
I may never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter.
Can it be,
I'm not meant to play this part?
Now I see, that if I were truly to be myself,
I would break my family's heart.

Who is that girl I see, staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Somehow I cannot hide?
Who I am, though I've tried.
When will my reflection show, who I am, inside?
How I pray, that a time will come,
I can free myself, from their expectations
On that day, I'll discover someway to be myself,
and to make my family proud.
They want a docile lamb,
No-one knows who I am.
Must there be a secret me,
I'm forced to hide?
Must I pretend that I am someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside?

Mulan,Make A Man Out Of You Lyrics,"
                    (Shang)
Let's get down to business
To defeat the Huns.
Did they send me daughters
When I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I've ever met,
But you can bet before were through,
Mister I'll make a man out of you.

Tranquil as a forest,
But on fire within.
Once you find your center,
You are sure to win.
You're a spineless pale pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue.
Somehow I'll make a man out of you.

(Chan-Po)I'm never gonna catch my breath.

(Yow)Say goodbye to those who knew me.

(Ling)Why was I a fool in school for cutting gym?

(Mushu)This guy's got them scared to death!

(Mulan/Ping)Hope he doesn't see right through me.

(Chan-Po)Now I really wish that I knew how to swim!

(Be a man)
We must be swift as the coursing river,
(Be a man)
With all the force of a great typhoon,
(Be a man)
With all the strength of a raging fire,
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.

Time is racing toward us,
'Til the Huns arrive.
Heed my every order,
And you might survive.
You're unsuited for the rage of war,
So pack up, go home, you're through.
How could I make a man out of you?

(Be a man)
We must be swift as the coursing river,
(Be a man)
With all the force of a great typhoon,
(Be a man)
With all the strength of a raging fire,
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.

Declares he's pleased with me-

What does he mean?
What does he know of me
This lord and master?
When he has looked at me what has he seen?
Something young
Soft and slim, 
Painted cheek, 
Tap'ring limb, 
Smiling lips
All for him, 
Eyes that shine
Just for him-
So he thinks... 

Just for him! 
Though the man may be
My Lord and Master, 
Though he may study me
As hard as he can, 
The smile beneath my smile

Oscar Hammerstein,Many A New Day Lyrics,"
                    Why should a woman who is healthy and strong
Blubber like a baby cause her man's gone away
A weepin' and a whalin' that he's done her wrong
That's one thing you'll never hear me say!
Never gonna think that the man I lose
Is the only man among men!
I'll snap my fingers to show I don't care
I'll buy me a brand new dress to wear
I'll scrub my neck
And I'll brush my hair
And start all over again

Many a new face will please my eye
Many a new love will find me
Never have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind me
Many a new day will dawn before I do

Many a like lad may kiss and fly
A kiss gone is bygone
Never have I asked an August sky
'Where has last July gone? '
Never have I wondered through the rye
Wondering where has some guy gone
Many a new day will dawn before I do

Many a new face will please my eye
Many a new love will find me
Never have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind me
Many a new day will dawn before I do!

Never have I chased the honeybee
Who carelessly conjoled me
Somebody just as sweet as he
Cheered me and consoled me
Never have I wept into my tea
Over the deal someone doled me

Many a new day will dawn

Many a red sun will set
Many a blue moon will shine
Before I do!

Many a new face will please my eye
Many a new love will find me
Never have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind me
Many a new day will dawn before I do!

Never have I chased the honeybee
Who carelessly conjoled me
Somebody just as sweet as he
Cheered me and consoled me

Startub as a farner wutg a brand new wife
Soon be liv-in in a brand new state!

Brand new state
Gonna treat you great

Gonna give you barley, carrots and per taters
Pasture for the cattle
Spinach and ter-may-ters
Flowers on the prairie where the june bugs zoom
Plen'y of ao air and plen'y of room
Plenty of room to swing a rope
Plen'y of heart and plen'y of hope

Where the wav-in wheat can sure smell sweet

And stars are breaking through

But your heart, whatever it tells you will be true

Out of my dreams and into his arms I long to fly

Oscar Hammerstein,Poor Jud Is Daid Lyrics,"
                    Poor Jud is daid
Poor Jud Fry is daid
All gather round his coffin now and cry
He had a heart of gold
And he wasn't very old
Oh why did such a fella have to die

Poor Jud is daid
Poor Jud Fry is daid
He's looking oh so peaceful and serene

And serene!

He's all laid down to rest
With his hands across his chest
His fingernails have never looked so clean

And then the preacher'd get up and he'd say: ""Folks, we are gathered
Here to mourn and growl our brother Jud Fry, who hung himself up
By a rope in a smokehouse, and then we have been weepin' and
Wailin' within some of the women. "" And then he'd say: ""Jud was the
Most misunderstood man in the territory. People used to think he was
A mean, ugly fella and they called him a dirty skunk and a northern
Pig stealer.

But the folks that really knowed 'I'm
Knowed that neath those dirty shirts he always wore
There beated a heart as big as all outdoors

As big as all outdoors

Jud Fry loved his fellow man

He loved his fellow man

He loved the birds of the forest
And the bees of the field
He loved the mice and the vermin in the barn
And he treated the rats like equals, which he knew was right!
And he loved the little children
He loved everybody and everything in the world
Only he never let on, so nobody ever noticed

Poor Jud is Daid
Poor Jud Fry is daid
His friends all weep and wail from miles around

Miles around!

The daisies in the dell will give out a different smell
Because poor Jud is underneath the ground

Poor Jud is daid, the candle lights his head
He's layin' in a coffin made of wood

Wood

And folks are feelin' sad cause they used to treat him bad
Now they know their friend has gone for good

Good

Poor Jud is daid, a candle lights his head
He's lookin oh so pretty and so nice
He looks like he's asleep
It's a shame that he won't keep
But it's summer and we're runinng out of ice

Oscar Hammerstein,Shall I Tell You What I Think Of You? Lyrics,"
                    Your servant! Your servant!
Indeed I'm not your servant --
Although you give me less than servant's pay --
I'm a free and independent employe
[Pronounced ""employay""]... (sigh) employee.

Because I'm a woman
You think, like ev'ry woman
I have to be a slave or concubine.
You conceited, self-indulgent libertine!... (sigh)
Libertine! [pronounced ""liberteen""]

How I wished I called him that!
Right to his face! Libertine!
And while we're on the subject, sire,
There are certain goings on around this place
That I wish to tell you I do not admire:
I do not like polygamy
Or even moderate bigamy
I realize
That in your eyes
That clearly makes a prig o' me.

But I am from a civilized land called Wales!
Where men like you are locked in county jails!
In your pursuit of pleasure, you
Have mistresses who treasure you

They have no ken of other men
Beside whom they can measure you

A flock of sheep and you're the only ram
No wonder you're the wonder of Siam!

[Spoken] I'm rather glad I didn't say that...
Not with the women right there... And the children

[Singing] The children, the children,
I'll not forget the children,
No matter where I go I'll always see
Those little faces looking up at me...

At first, when I started to teach,
They were shy and remained out of reach,
But lately I've thought
One or two have been caught
By a word I have said
Or a sentence I've read
And I've heard an occasional question
That implied, at least, a suggestion
That the work I've been trying to do
Was beginning to show with a few...

That Prince Chululongkorn
Is very like his father.
He's stubborn-but inquistitive and smart...
I must leave this place before they break my heart
I must leave this place before they break my heart!

Goodness! I had no idea it was so late.

Shall It tell you what I think of you?
You're spoiled!
You're a conscientious worker
But your spoiled.
Giving credit where it's due
There is much I like in you
But it's also very true
That your spoiled!
Everybody's always bowing to the King
Everybody has to grovel to the King.
By your Buddha you are blessed
By your ladies you're caressed,
But the one who loves you best is the King.

All that bowing and kow-towing
To remind you of your royalty,
I find a most disgusting exhibition.
I wouldn't ask a Siamese cat
To demonstrate his loyalty
By taking this ridiculous position
How would you like it if you were a man
Playing the part of a toad.
Crawling around on your elbows and knees.
Eating the dust of the road!...

Toads! Toads! All of your people are toads!
Yes, Your Majesty;
No, Your Majesty.
Tell us how low to go, Your Majesty;
Make some more decrees, Your Majesty,
Don't let us up off out knees, Your Majesty.
Give us a kick, if you please Your Majesty
Give us a kick, if you would, Your Majesty
Oh, That was good, Your Majesty!

Oscar Hammerstein,Shall We Dance Lyrics,"
                    (Anna sings)
We've just been introduced
I do not know you well
But when the music started something drew me to your side
So many men and girls are in each others arms
It made me think we might be similarly occupied

Shall we dance, on a bright cloud of music
Shall we fly
Shall we dance
Shall we then say goodnight and mean goodbye
Or per chance, when the last little star has left the sky
Shall we still be together with our arms about each other
And shall you be my new romance
On the clear understanding that this kind of thing can happen
Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance

[Interlude:]

Shall we dance, on a bright cloud of music
Shall we fly
Shall we dance
Shall we then say goodnight and mean goodbye

Or per chance, when the last little star has leave the sky

Shall we still be together with our arms about each other
And shall you be my new...

Oscar Hammerstein,Something Wonderful Lyrics,"
                    This is a man who thinks with his heart, 
His heart is not always wise.
This is a man who stumbles and falls, 
But this is a man who tries.

This is a man you'll forgive and forgive, 
And help protect, as long as you live... 
He will not always say
What you would have him say, 
But now and then he'll do
Something
Wonderful.

He has a thousand dreams
That won't come true, 
You know that he believes in them
And that's enough for you.

You'll always go along, 
Defend him when he's wrong
And tell him, when he's strong
He is
Wonderful
He'll always
Needs your love
And so he'll get your love.
A man who needs your love
Can be
Wonderful.

She'll always go along
Defend him when he's wrong
And tell him when he's strong
He is wonderful.
He'll always need her love
And so he'll get her love

A woman is a female who is human, 
Designed for pleasing man, the human male.
A human male is pleased by many women, 
And all the rest you hear is fairy tale.

[ANNA]

Then tell me how this fairy tale bagan, sir.
You cannot call it just a poet's trick
Explain to me why many men are faithful
And true to one wife only.

[Spoken] They are sick! 
[Singing] A girl must be like a blossom
With honey for just one man.
A man must be like honey bee
And gather all he can.

Oscar Hammerstein,The Farmer And The Cowman Lyrics,"
                    Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
One man likes to push a plow
The other likes to chase a cow
But that's no reason why they can't be friends

Territory folks should stick together
Territory folks should all be pals
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals

Territory folks should stick together
Territory folks should all be pals
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals!

I'd like to say a word for the farmer

Well, say it!

He come out west and made a lot of changes

That's right!

He come out west and built a lot of fences
And built 'em right across our cattle ranges!

Why don't you dirt strangers go back to Missouri Where you belong?

We got just as much right here!

Shut up!
The farmer a good in criticism
No matter what the cowman says or thinks
You seldom see 'I'm drinkin in a bar room

Unless somebody else is buying drinks!

Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
The cowman ropes a cow with ease
The farmer steals her butter and cheese
That's no reason why they can't be friends

Territory folks should stick together
Territory folks should all be pals
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals!

I'd like to say a word for the cowboy

You would!

The road he treads is difficult and stony
He rides fer days on end with just a pony for a friend

I sure am feeling sorry for the pony!

The farmer should be sociable with the cowboy
If he rides by an' asks fer food and water
Don't treat 'I'm like a louse
Make him welcome in your house

But be sure that you've locked up your wife and daughters!

(They all offend themselves at the same time and fight)

Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
One man likes to push a plow
The other likes to chase a cow
But that's no reason why they can't be friends

Gun shot

Ain't nobody gonna slug anything! This here's a party!
Break it up ya two ol' fools! Alright, Andrew, sing it.
Dum-dah-dee-um-dum-dum

Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends

Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends
One man likes to push a plow
The other likes to chase a cow
But that's no reason why they can't be friends

And when this territory is a state
An' joins the Union just like all the others
The farmer, the cowman, and the merchant
Must all behave theirselves and act like brothers

I'll teach you all a little sayin'
And learn the words by heart the way you should
I don't say I'm no better than anybody else
But I'll be danged if I ain't just as good!

Oscar Hammerstein,The Surrey With The Fringe On Top Lyrics,"
                    When I take you out tonight with me
Honey, here's the way it's gonna be
You will sit behind a team of snow white horses
In the slickest gig you've ever seen

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppen strutters
Nosy pokes will peek through their shutters and their eyes will pop!

The wheels are yellow, the upholstry's brown
The dashboard's genuine leather
With eisenglass curtains you can roll right down
In case there's a change in the weather

Two bright side lights winkin' and blinkin'
Ain't no finer rig I'm a thinkin'
You can keep your rig if you're thinkin that I'd keer to swap
Fer that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top

Would you say the fringe was made of silk?
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Has it really got a team of snow white horses?
One's like snow, the other's more like milk

All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top
When we hit that road hell-for-leather
Cats and dogs will dance in the heather
Birds and frogs will sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along
The cows'll moo in the clover
The river will ripple out a whispered song
And whisper over and over
Don't you wish you'd go on forever
Don't you wish you'd go on forever
Don't you wish you'd go on forever
And you'd never stop?
In that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top

I can see the stars gettin' blurry
When we ride back home in the surrey
Ridin' slowly home on the surrey
With the fringe on top
I can feel the day gettin' older
Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder
Till it falls kerplop

The sun is swimming on the rim of a hill
The moon is taking a header
And just when I'm thinking all the earth is still
A lark'll wake up in the meader

Hush, you bird. My baby's a sleepin'
Maybe got a dream worth a keepin'
Whoa, you team and just keep a creepin'
At a slow clip clop
Don't you hurry little surrey

Oscar Hammerstein,We Kiss In A Shadow Lyrics,"
                    We kiss in a shadow,
We hide from the moon,
Our meetings are few,
And over too soon.

We speak in a whisper,
Afraid to be heard;
When people are near,
We speak not a word.
Alone in our secret,
Together we sigh,
For one smiling day to be free
To kiss in the sunlight
And say to the sky;
""Behold and believe what you see!
Behold how my lover loves me! ""

[Tuptim]

We speak in a whisper,
Afraid to be heard;
When people are near,

[Lun tha]

We speak not a word.
Alone in our secret,
Together we sigh,
For one smiling day to be free

[Both]

Oscar Hammerstein,Oh What A Beautiful Mornin' Lyrics,"
                    There's a bright golden haze on the meadow
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow
The corn is as high as an elaphant's eye
And it looks like it's climbing clear up to the sky

Oh what a beautiful mornin'
Oh what a beautiful day
I've got a beautiful feelin'
Everything's going my way

All the cattle are standing like statues
All the cattle are standing like statues
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by
But a little brown maverick is winkin' her eye

Oh what a beautiful mornin'
Oh what a beautiful day
I've got a beautiful feeling
Everything's going my way

All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree
And an old weepin' willer is laughin' at me!

Oscar Hammerstein,People Will Say We're In Love Lyrics,"
                    Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors gossip all day behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue
Here is the gist
A practical list of don'ts fer you

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love

Laughs at your jokes-

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes musn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove
Sweetheart, they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love!

Some people claim that you're to blame as much as I
Why do you take the trouble to bake my favorite pie?
Grantin' your wish, I carved our initals on that tree
Just keep a slice of all the advice you give so free

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
'Til the stars fade from above
They'll see it's all right with me

Oscar Hammerstein,A Puzzlement Lyrics,"
                    When I was a boy
World was better spot.
What was so was so, 
What was not was not.
Now I am a man; 
World have changed a lot.
Some things nearly so, 
Others nearly not.

There are times I almost think
I am not sure of what I absolutely know.
Very often find confusion
In conclusion I concluded long ago
In my head are many facts T
Hat, as a student, I have studied to procure, 
In my head are many facts... 
Of which I wish I was more certain I was sure! 

[Spoken:] Is a puzzlement
What to tell growing son
What for instance, shall I say to him of women?
Shall I educate him on the ancient lines?
Shall I tell the boy as far as he is able, 
To respect his wives and love his concubines?
Shall I tell him everyone is like the other, 
And the better of the two is really neither?
If I tell him this I think he won't believe it-
And I nearly think that I don't believe it either! 

When my father was a king
He was a king who knew exactly what he knew, 
And his brain was not a thing
Forever swinging to and fro and fro and to.
Shall I, then be like my father
And be willfully unmoveable and strong?
Or is it better to be right?... 
Or am I right when I believe I may be wrong?
Shall I join with other nations in alliance?
If allies are weak, am I not best alone?
If allies are strong with power to protect me, 
Might they not protect me out of all I own?
Is a danger to be trusting one another, 
One will seldom want to do what other wishes; 
Bul unless someday somebody trust somebody
There'll be nothing left on earth exceot fishes! 

There are times I almost think
Nobody sure of what he absolutely know.
Everybody find confusion
In conclusion he concluded long ago
And it puzzle me to learn
That tho' a man may be in doubt of what he know, 
Very quickly he will fight... 
He'll fight to prove that what he does not know is so! 
Oh-h-h-h-h-h Sometimes I think that people going mad! 
Ah-h-h-h-h-h! Sometimes I think that people not so bad! 
But no matter what I think I must go on living life.
As leader of my kingdom I must go forth, 
Be father to my children and husband to each wife
Excetera, excetera, and so forth.
If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way! 
Everyday I try to live another day. If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the
Way! 
Everyday I do my best for one-more day!

Oscar Hammerstein,All Er Nothin' Lyrics,"
                    You'll have to be a little more standoffish
When fellers offer you a buggy ride

I'll give an imitation of a crawfish
And dig myself a hole where I can hide

I heard how you was kicken' up some capers
When I was off in Kansas City, Mo.
I heard some things you couldn't print in papers
From fellers who been talkin' like they know! 

Foot! 
I only did the kind of things I orta, sorta
To you I was as faithful as can be, for me
Them stories 'bout the way I lost my bloomers-rumors! 
A lot of tempest in a pot o' tea! 

The whole don't sound very good to me.

Well, you see

I go and sow my last wild oat
I cut out all shenanigans
I save my money, don't gamble or drink
In the back room down at Flannigans! 
I give up lotsa other things
A gentleman never mentions
But before I give up any more
I wanna know your intentions! 

With me, it's all er nuthin'
Is it all or nuthin' with you?
It cain't be in between
It can't be now and then
No half and half romance will do! 

I'm a one woman man, home lovin' type
All complete with slippers and pipe
Take me like I am er leave me be! 
If you can't give me all, give me nuthin'
And nuthin's what you'll git from me

Not even somethin'

Nuthin's what you'll git from me! 

It cain't be in between

Nnn-mmm

It cain't be now and then

No half and half romance will do

Would you build me a house
All painted white
Cute and clean and purty and bright

Big enough fer two but not fer three! 

Suposin' that we should have a third one

He'd better look a lot like me

No spittin' image

He'd better look a lot like me! 

With you it's all er nuthin'
All fer you and nothin' fer me
But if a wife is wise, she's gotta realize
That men like you are wild and free

So I ain't gonna fuss, ain't gonna frown
Have your fun, go out on the town
Stay up late and don't come home til three! 
And go right off to sleep if you're sleepy
There's no use waitin' up fer me

Oh, Ado Annie! 

No use waitin' up fer me!

By your pupils you'll be taught.

You'll forgive me if I boast --
And I've now become an expert,
On the subject I like most.

Oscar Hammerstein,Hello Young Lovers Lyrics,"
                    When I think of Tom.
I think of a night,
When the earth smelled of summer
And the sky was streaked with white,
The soft mist of England
Was sleeping on a hill.

I remember this,
And I always will...
There are new lovers now
On the same silent hill,
Looking on the same blue sea.
And I know Tom and I are a part of them all--
And they're all a part of Tom and me.

Hello young lovers, whoever you are,
I hope your troubles are few.
All my good wishes go with you tonight,
I've been in love like you.

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star,
Be brave and faithful and true,
Cling very close to each other tonight.
I've been in love like you.

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels,
And to fly down the street in a trance.
You fly down a street on the chance that you meet,
And you meet--not really by chance.

Don't cry young lovers, whatever you do,
Don't cry because I'm alone;
All of my memories are happy tonight,
I've had a love of my own.
I've had a love of my own, like yours-
I've had a love of my own.

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star,
Be brave and faithful and true,
Cling very close to each other tonight.
I've been in love like you.

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels,
And to fly down the street in a trance.
You fly down a street on the chance that you meet,
And you meet--not really by chance.

Don't cry young lovers, whatever you do,
Don't cry because I'm alone;
All of my memories are happy tonight,
I've had a love of my own.
I've had a love of my own, like yours-
I've had a love of my own.

Oscar Hammerstein,I Cain't Say No Lyrics,"
                    It ain't so much a question of knowin' what to do
I knowed what's right an' wrong since I've been ten
I've heard a lot of stories and I reckon they're true
About how girls are put upon by men
I know I musn't fall into the pit
But when I'm with a feller
I ferget!

I'm just a girl who cain't say no
I'm in a terrible fix
I always say 'come on, let's go'
Just when I oughta say 'nix'

When a person tries to kiss a girl
I know she oughta give his face a smack!
But as soon as someone kisses me
I somehow sorta want to kiss him back!

I'm just a fool when lights are low
I cain't be prissy an' quaint
I ain't the type that can faint
How can I be what I ain't
I cain't say no

Watcha gonna do when a feller gets flirty
And starts to talk purty
Whatcha gonna do?
Supposin that he says
Your lips are like cherries
Or roses or berries
Whatcha gonna do?

Supposin that he says
That yer sweeter than cream
And he's gotta have cream or die
Whatcha gonna do when he talks that way?
Spit in his eye?

I'm just a girl who cain't say no
Cain't seem to say it at all
I hate to disserpoint a beau
When he is payin' a call!

Fer a while I act refined and cool
A settin on the velveteen setee
Then I think of that ol' golden rule
And do fer him what he would do fer me

I cain't resist a Romeo
In a sombero and chaps
Soon as I sit on their laps
Somethin' inside of me snaps
I cain't say no!

I'm just a girl who cain't say no
Kissin's my favorite food
With or without the mistletoe
I'm in a holiday mood!

Other girls are coy and hard to catch
But other girls ain't havin' any fun
Every time I lose a wrastlin' match
I have a funny feeling that I won

Though I can feel the undertoe
I never make a complaint
'Till it's too late for restraint
Then when I want to I cain't
I cain't say no!

Oscar Hammerstein,I Have Dreamed Lyrics,"
                    I have dreamed that your arms are lovely, 
I have dreamed what a joy you'll be.
I have dreamed every word you whisper.
When you're close, 
Close to me.
How you look in the glow of evening
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view.

In these dreams I've loved you so
That by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you, 
I will love being loved by you.

[TUPTIM]

Alone and awake I've looked at the stars, 
The same that smile on you; 
And time and again I've thought all the things T
Hat you were thinking too.

I have dreamed that your arms are lovely, 
I have dreamed what a joy you'll be.
I have dreamed every word you whisper.
When you're close, 
Close to me.
How you look in the glow of evening
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view.

In these dreams I've loved you so
That by now I think I know.

Oscar Hammerstein,I Whistle A Happy Tune Lyrics,"
                    Whenever I feel afraid
I hold my head erect
And whistle a happy tune
So no one will suspect
I'm afraid

While shivering in my shoes
I strike a careless pose
And whistle a happy tune
And no one ever knows
I'm afraid

The result of this deception
Is very strange to tell
For when I fool the people
I fear I fool myself as well!

I whistle a happy tune
And ev'ry single time
The happiness in the tune
Convinces me that I'm not afraid

Make believe you're brave
And the trick will take you far.
You may be as brave
As you make believe you are

You may be as brave
As you make believe you are

[Louis]

While shivering in my shoes
I strike a careless pose
And whistle a happy tune
And no one ever knows,
I'm afraid

The result of this deception
Is very strange to tell
For when I fool the people
I fear I fool myself as well!

And ev'ry single time
The happiness in the tune

let my golden chances pass me by Soon

Oscar Hammerstein,Kansas City Lyrics,"
                    I got to Kansas City on a Firday
By Saturday I learned a thing or two
Cuz up to then I didn't have an idy
Of whut the modern world was comin' to!

I counted twenty gas buggies goin' by their sels
Almost every time I took a walk
Then I put my ear to a bell telephone
And a strange woman started in to talk

To you?

What next?

Yeah what?

What next?
Gather round!

Everythin's up to date in Kansas City
They've gone about as fur as they can go
They went and built a skyscraper seven stories high
About as high as a buildin' oughta grow
Everythin's like a dream in Kansas City
It's better than a magic lantren show
You can turn the radiator on
Whenever you want some heat
With every kind of comfort
Every house is all complete
You can walk to privies in the rain
And never wet your feet!
They've gone about as fur as they can go

Yes sir!
They've gone about as fur as they can go

Everythin's up to date in Kansas City
They've gone about as fur as they can go
They've got a big theyater they call a burleeque
For fifty cents you can see a dandy show

Gals?

One of the gals was fat and pink and pretty
As round above as she was round below
I could swear that she was padded
From her shoulder to her heel
But latter in the second act
When she began to peel
She proved that everyhin' she had was absolutely real!
She went about as fur as she can go

Yes sir!
She went about as fur as she can go!

Pocahontas,The Virginia Company Lyrics,"
                    [Men]
In sixteen hundred seven
We sail the open sea
For glory, God, and gold
And The Virginia Company

For the New World is like heaven
And we'll all be rich and free
Or so we have been told
By The Virginia Company

For glory, God and gold
And The Virginia Company

On the beaches of Virginny
There's diamonds like debris
There's silver rivers flow
And gold you pick right off a tree

With a nugget for my Winnie
And another one for me
And all the rest'll go

Pocahontas,Steady As The Beating Drum (Reprise) Lyrics,"

As the river cuts his path
Though the river's
Proud and strong
He will choose the
Smoothest course
That's why rivers
Live so long
They're steady ...
As the steady

What can you expect
From filthy little heathens?
Their whole disgusting race is like a curse.
Their skin's a hellish red
They're only good when dead
They're vermin, as I said
And worse

[English Settlers]
They're savages! Savages!

[Ratcliffe]
Barely even human
[English Settlers]
Savages! Savages!

[Ratcliffe]
Drive them from our shore!
They're not like you and me
Which means they must be evil
We must sound the drums of war!

[English Settlers]
They're savages! Savages!
Dirty redskin devils!
Now we sound the drums of war!

[Powhatan]
This is what we feared
The paleface is a demon
The only thing they feel at all is greed

[Kekata]
Beneath that milky hide
There's emptiness inside

[Native Americans]
I wonder if they even bleed?
They're savages! Savages!
Barely even human
Savages! Savages!

[Powhatan]
Killers at the core

[Kekata]
They're different from us
Which means they can't be trusted

Pocahontas,Pocahontas Lyrics,"
                    Aurora borealis
The icy sky at night
Our paddles break the water
In a long and hurried flight
From the white man and the fields of green
And the homeland we've never seen
They killed us in our tepee
They cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Cryin' on the ground
But the big guns and the wagon wheels come
Yes, and the night falls on the setting sun
They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little room at the top of the stairs
With an Indian rug and a pipe to share
I wish a was a trapper
I would give thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And to find out how she felt
In the morning on the fields of green
In the homeland we've never seen
Yes and maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
We'll sit and talk of Hollywood
And the good things there for hire
And the Astrodome and the first tepee
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me

Pocahontas,"Mine, Mine, Mine Lyrics","
                    [Ratcliffe]
The gold of Cortйs
The jewels of Pizarro
Will seem like mere trinkets
By this time tomorrow
The gold we find here
Will dwarf them by far
Oh, with all ya got in ya, boys
Dig up Virginia, boys

Mine, boys, mine ev'ry mountain
And dig, boys, dig 'til ya drop
Grab a pick, boys
Quick, boys
Shove in a shovel
Uncover those lovely
Pebbles that sparkle and shine
It's gold and it's mine, mine, mine

Dig and dig and dig and diggety...

Hey nonny nonny
Ho nonny nonny
Ratcliffe
Oh, how I love it!
Riches for Cheap!
Wiggins
There'll be heaps of it...
Ratcliffe
And I'll be on top of the heap!

My rivals back home
It's not that I'm bitter
But think how they'll squirm
When they see how I glitter!
The ladies at court
Will be all a-twitter
The king will reward me
He'll knight me... No, lord me!

It's mine, mine, mind
For the taking
It's mine, boys
Mine me that gold!
With those nuggets dug...

It's glory they'll gimme
My dear friend, King Jimmy
Will probably build me a shrine
When all of the gold is mine

[English Settlers]
Dig and dig and dig and diggety
Dig and dig and dig and diggety-dig!
[Smith]
All of my life, I have searched for a land
Like this one
A wilder, more challenging country
I couldn't design
Hundreds of dangers await
And I don't plan to miss one
In a land I can claim
A land I can tame
The greatest adventure is mine!

[Ratcliffe and English Settlers together]

[Ratcliffe]
Keep on working, lands
Don't be shirking, lands
Mine, boys, mind
Mine me that gold
Beautiful gold
[English Settlers]
Mine
Find a mother lode
Then find another load!
Dig! Dig! And diggety
Dig! Dig! For that gold
All
Make this island
My land!
[Ratcliffe]
Make the mounds big, boys
I'd help you to dig, boys
But I've got this crick in me spine
[Smith]
This land we behold...
[Ratcliffe]
This beauty untold...
[Smith]
A man can be bold!
It all can be sold!

[Ratcliffe and English Settlers together]

[Ratcliffe]
And the gold
Is...
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!

We know which is here
All the riches here
From this minute

Pocahontas,Kleuren Van De Wind Lyrics,"
                    Ben ik een onwetende wilde?
Jij bevoer de hele wereld,
Je kijkt vast niet verkeerd.
Toch heb ik het idee,
Dat de wilde van ons twee
Degeen is die niet luistert en
Niet leert.
Die niet leert.

Jij denkt dat land
Waar jij belandt van jou is.
Jij plukt de aarde
Als een aarsgier kaal.
Maar ik weet
Elke rots
En boom,
Elk wezen
Heeft een ziel,
Heeft een leven,
Heeft een taal.

Jij noemt de mensen eigenlijk
Pas mensen als die mensen
Precies zo zijn als jij.
Maar treed eens in het voetspoor
Van een vreemde en dan
Leer je in een oogwenk zoveel bij.

Hoor je ooit de wolf een ode
Brengen aan de maan?
Of vraag jij ooit een lynx waarom
Hij spint?
Ben je doof voor alle stemmen
Van de bergen?
Ben je blind voor alle kleuren
Van de wind?
Ben je blind voor alle kleuren
Van de wind?

Kom rennen, laat je leiden door
De larix.
Het hert toont zijn betoverend domein.
Verover het en rol je door die rijkdom.
Maar vraag nooit what het waard
Zou kunnen zijn.

De regen, de rivier,
Het zijn mijn broeders.
De reiger en de otter,
Lucht en land.
En alles staat met alles
In verbinding.
In een cirkel,
Een oneindig groot verband.

Hoe hoog raakt de esdoorn
Ooit?
Wie de bomen rooit
Hoort het antwoord nooit.
Die hoort nooit de wolf een
Ode brengen aan de maan.
In wit of koper,
Ongeacht je tint.

Blijf niet doof voor alle stemmen
Van de bergen.
Blijf niet blind voor alle kleuren
Van de wind.
Wie de aarde zo begeert,
Vindt slechts aarde tot hij leert
Het te zien

Pocahontas,Just Around The Riverbend Lyrics,"
                    [Pocahontas]
What I love most about rivers is:
You can't step in the same river twice
The water's always changing, always flowing
But people, I guess, can't live like that
We all must pay a price
To be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing
What's around the riverbend
Waiting just around the riverbend

I look once more
Just around the riverbend
Beyond the shore
Where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for
What I dream the day might send
Just around the riverbend
For me
Coming for me

I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming
For a handsome sturdy husband
Who builds handsome sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming?
Just around the riverbend
Just around the riverbend

I look once more
Just around the riverbend
Beyond the shore
Somewhere past the sea
Don't know what for...
Why do all my dreams extend
Just around the riverbend?
Just around the riverbend...

Should I choose the smoothest course
Steady as the beating drum?
Should I marry Kocoum?
Is all my dreaming at an end?
Or do you still wait for me, Dream Giver
Just around the riverbend?

Pocahontas,Where Do I Go From Here Lyrics,"
                    The earth is cold
The fields are bare
The branches fold against the wind that's everywhere

The birds move on
So they survive
When snow so deep 
The bears all sleep to keep themselves alive

They do what they must for now
And trust in their plan
If I trust in mine, somehow I might find who I am

CHORUS
But where do I go from here?
So many voices ringing in my ear
Which is the voice that I was meant to hear?
How will I know?
Where do I go from here?

My world has changed and so have I
I've learned to choose
And even learned to say goodbye

The path ahead's so hard to see
It winds and bends but where it ends 
Depends on only me

In my heart I don't feel part of so much I've known
Now it seems it's time to start, 
A new life on my own

CHORUS
But where do I go from here?
So many voices ringing in my ear
Which is the voice that I was meant to hear?
How will I know?

Pocahontas,Colors Of The Wind Lyrics,"
                    You think I'm just an ignorant savage
And you've been so many places; I guess it must be so
But still I cannot see, if the savage one is me
How can there be so much that you don't know?
You don't know...

You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name.

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle in a hoop that never ends

How high will a sycamore grow?
If you cut it down then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind

You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/p/pocahontas/ + /p/pocahontas/colors+of+the+wind_20465852.html,0,1,you think i'm just an ignorant savage and you've been so many places i guess it must be so but still i cannot see if the savage one is me how can there be so much that you don't know you don't know you think you own whatever land you land on the earth is just a dead thing you can claim but i know every rock and tree and creature has a life has a spirit has a name you think the only people who are people are the people who look and think like you but if you walk the footsteps of a stranger you'll learn things you never knew you never knew have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned can you sing with all the voices of the mountain can you paint with all the colors of the wind can you paint with all the colors of the wind come run the hidden pine trails of the forest come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth come roll in all the riches all around you and for once never wonder what they're worth the rainstorm and the river are my brothers the heron and the otter are my friends and we are all connected to each other in a circle in a hoop that never ends how high will a sycamore grow if you cut it down then you'll never know and you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon for whether we are white or copper skinned we need to sing with all the voices of the mountain we need to paint with all the colors of the wind you can own the earth and still all you'll own is earth until you can paint with all the colors of the wind,you think i m just an ignorant savage and you ve been so many places i guess it must be so but still i cannot see if the savage one is me how can there be so much that you don t know you don t know you think you own whatever land you land on the earth is just a dead thing you can claim but i know every rock and tree and creature has a life has a spirit has a name you think the only people who are people are the people who look and think like you but if you walk the footsteps of a stranger you ll learn things you never knew you never knew have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned can you sing with all the voices of the mountain can you paint with all the colors of the wind can you paint with all the colors of the wind come run the hidden pine trails of the forest come taste the sun sweet berries of the earth come roll in all the riches all around you and for once never wonder what they re worth the rainstorm and the river are my brothers the heron and the otter are my friends and we are all connected to each other in a circle in a hoop that never ends how high will a sycamore grow if you cut it down then you ll never know and you ll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon for whether we are white or copper skinned we need to sing with all the voices of the mountain we need to paint with all the colors of the wind you can own the earth and still all you ll own is earth until you can paint with all the colors of the wind
Pocahontas,If I Never Knew You Lyrics,"
                    [Smith/Boy]
If I never knew you
If I never felt this love
I would have no inkling of
How precious life can be
If I never held you
I would never have a clue
How at last I'd find in you
The missing part of me
In this world so full of fear
Full of rage and lies
I can see the truth so clear
In your eyes
So dry your eyes
And I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you

[Pocahontas/Girl]
I thought our love would be so beautiful
Somehow we'd make the whole world bright
I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong
All they'd leave us were these whispers in the night
But still my heart is saying we were right
For If I never knew you

[Next Part, Pocahontas starts earlier and Smith follows after so they are overlaping as they sing the words.]

[Smith/Boy]
There's no moment I regret

[Pocahontas/Girl]
If I never knew this love

[Smith/Boy]
Since the moment that we met

[Pocahontas/Girl]
I would have no inkling of

[Smith/Boy]
If our time has gone too fast

[Pocahontas/Girl]
How precious life can be

[Smith/Boy]
I've lived at last

[Pocahontas' Friend; Speaking]
Pocahontas?

[Pocahontas/Girl; Speaking to Smith]
I can't leave you.

[Smith/Boy; Speaking to Pocahontas]
You never will. No matter what happens to me, I'll always be with you. Forever.

[Smith/Boy; Singing]
And I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Empty as the sky

[Pocahontas/Girl]
Never knowing why

[Both]
Lost forever

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?

Where the wavin' wheat,
Can sure smell sweet,
When the wind comes right behind the rain,

Oklahoma, every night my honey lamb and I,
Sit alone and talk,
And watch a hawk,
Makin' lazy circles in the sky,

We know we belong to the land
and the land we belong to is grand

And when we say, hey! a yippy-i-o-ey
We're only sayin' You're doin' fine Oklahoma,

Richard Rodgers,"Oh, What A Beautiful Mornin', Song (from ""Oklahoma"") Lyrics","
                    There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,

The corn is as high as an elephants eye,
An' it looks like it's climbing clear up in the sky.

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the cattle are standin' like statues,
All the cattle are standin' like statues,
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by,
But a little brown mav'rick is winkin' her eye.

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree
And an old weepin' willer is laughin' at me

Richard Rodgers,It Never Entered My Mind Lyrics,"
                    Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

Richard Rodgers,Favorite Things Lyrics,"
                    Rain drops on roses and whiskers on kittens,
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens,
Brown paper packages tied up with strings...
These are a few of my favorite things.

Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudles,
Door bells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles,
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings...
These are a few of my favorite things.

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes,
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes,
Silver white winters that melt into spring-
These are a few of my favorite things.

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling bad...
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/richard+rodgers/ + /r/richard+rodgers/favorite+things_20541551.html,1,0,rain drops on roses and whiskers on kittens bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens brown paper packages tied up with strings these are a few of my favorite things cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudles door bells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings these are a few of my favorite things girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes silver white winters that melt into spring- these are a few of my favorite things when the dog bites when the bee stings when i'm feeling bad i simply remember my favorite things and then i don't feel so bad,rain drops on roses and whiskers on kittens bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens brown paper packages tied up with strings these are a few of my favorite things cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudles door bells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings these are a few of my favorite things girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes silver white winters that melt into spring these are a few of my favorite things when the dog bites when the bee stings when i m feeling bad i simply remember my favorite things and then i don t feel so bad
Richard Rodgers,Dancing On The Ceiling Lyrics,"
                    The world is lyrical
Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though he's some other place, his face I see

At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my love is there

He dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night

I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
But there's my love
Up above

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""
But I'm so grateful to discover
He's still there

I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor

Tarzan,Son Of Man Lyrics,"

And the wisdom to be wise
All these things will come to you in time
On this journey that you're making
There'll be answers that you'll seek
And it's you who'll climb the mountain
It's you who'll reach the peak

Son of Man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of Man, a man in time you'll be

Though there's no one there to guide you
No one to take your hand
But with faith and understanding
You will journey from boy to man

Son of Man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of Man, a man in time you'll be

In learning you will teach
And in teaching you will learn
You'll find your place beside the ones you love
Oh, and all the things you dreamed of
The visions that you saw
Well, the time is drawing near now
It's yours to claim it all

Son of Man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride

Show me everything and tell me how
It all means something
And yet nothing to me

I can see there's so much to learn
It's all so close and yet so far
I see myself as people see me
Oh, I just know there's something bigger out there

I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

Every gesture, every move that she makes
Makes me feel like never before
Why do I have
This growing need to be beside her

Ooo, these emotions I never knew
Of some other world far beyond this place
Beyond the trees, above the clouds
I see before me a new horizon

Come with me now to see my world
Where there's beauty beyond your dreams
Can you feel the things I feel
Right now, with you
Take my hand
There's a world I need to know

I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these strangers like me

There's children throwing snowballs Instead of throwing heads They're busy building toys And absolutely no one's dead There's frost on every window Oh, I can't believe my eyes And in my bones I feel the warmth That's coming from inside Oh, look What's this? They're hanging mistletoe; they kiss? Why, that looks so unique, inspired! They're gathering around to hear a story Roasting chestnuts on a fire What's this? What's this? In here, they've got a little tree How queer And who would ever think? And why? They're covering it with tiny little things They've got electric lights on strings And there's a smile on everyone So, now correct me if I'm wrong This looks like fun, this looks like fun Oh, could it be I got my wish? What's this? Oh, my, what now? The children are asleep But look, there's nothing underneath No ghouls, no witches here to scream And scare them or ensnare them Only little cozy things, secure inside their dreamland What's this? The monsters are all missing And the nightmares can't be found And in their place there seems To be good feeling all around Instead of screams, I swear I can hear music in the air The smell of cakes and pies Are absolutely everywhere The sights, the sounds They're everywhere and all around I've never felt so good before This empty place inside of me is filling up I simply cannot get enough I want it, oh, I want it, oh I want it for my own I've got to know, I've got to know What is this place that I have found?

The Nightmare Before Christmas,Jack's Lament,"There are few who deny at what I do I am the best For my talents are renowned far and wide When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night I excel without ever even trying With the slightest little effort of my ghost-like charms I have seen grown men give out a shriek With the wave of my hand and a well-placed moan I have swept the very bravest off their feet Yet year after year it's the same routine And I grow so weary of the sound of screams And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King Have grown so tired of the same old thing Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones An emptiness began to grow There's something out there far from my home A longing that I've never known I'm the master of fright and a demon of light And I'll scare you right out of your pants To a guy in Kentucky I'm Mister Unlucky And I'm known throughout England and France And since I am dead I can take off my head To recite Shakespearean quotations No animal nor man can scream like I can With the fury of my recitations But who here would ever understand That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin Would tire of his crown - if they only understood He'd give it all up if he only could Oh, there's an empty place in my bones That calls out for something unknown The fame and praise come year after year Does nothing for these empty tears",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/jacks-lament.html,0,0,there are few who deny at what i do i am the best for my talents are renowned far and wide when it comes to surprises in the moonlit night i excel without ever even trying with the slightest little effort of my ghost-like charms i have seen grown men give out a shriek with the wave of my hand and a well-placed moan i have swept the very bravest off their feet yet year after year it's the same routine and i grow so weary of the sound of screams and i jack the pumpkin king have grown so tired of the same old thing oh somewhere deep inside of these bones an emptiness began to grow there's something out there far from my home a longing that i've never known i'm the master of fright and a demon of light and i'll scare you right out of your pants to a guy in kentucky i'm mister unlucky and i'm known throughout england and france and since i am dead i can take off my head to recite shakespearean quotations no animal nor man can scream like i can with the fury of my recitations but who here would ever understand that the pumpkin king with the skeleton grin would tire of his crown - if they only understood he'd give it all up if he only could oh there's an empty place in my bones that calls out for something unknown the fame and praise come year after year does nothing for these empty tears,there are few who deny at what i do i am the best for my talents are renowned far and wide when it comes to surprises in the moonlit night i excel without ever even trying with the slightest little effort of my ghost like charms i have seen grown men give out a shriek with the wave of my hand and a well placed moan i have swept the very bravest off their feet yet year after year it s the same routine and i grow so weary of the sound of screams and i jack the pumpkin king have grown so tired of the same old thing oh somewhere deep inside of these bones an emptiness began to grow there s something out there far from my home a longing that i ve never known i m the master of fright and a demon of light and i ll scare you right out of your pants to a guy in kentucky i m mister unlucky and i m known throughout england and france and since i am dead i can take off my head to recite shakespearean quotations no animal nor man can scream like i can with the fury of my recitations but who here would ever understand that the pumpkin king with the skeleton grin would tire of his crown if they only understood he d give it all up if he only could oh there s an empty place in my bones that calls out for something unknown the fame and praise come year after year does nothing for these empty tears
The Nightmare Before Christmas,Jack's Obsession,"Something's up with Jack Something's up with Jack Don't know if we're ever Going to get him back He's all alone up there Locked away inside Never says a word Hope he hasn't died Something's up with Jack Something's up with Jack Christmas time is buzzing in my skull Will it let me be? I cannot tell There are so many things I cannot grasp When I think I've got it, and then at last Through my bony fingers it does slip Like a snowflake in a fiery grip Something's here I'm not quite getting Though I try, I keep forgetting Like a memory long since past Here in an instant, gone in a flash What does it mean? What does it mean? In these little bric-a-brac A secret's waiting to be cracked These dolls and toys confuse me so Confound it all, I love it though Simple objects, nothing more But something's hidden through a door Though I do not have the key Something's here I cannot see What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? I've read these Christmas books so many times I know the stories, and I know the rhymes I know the Christmas carols all by heart My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart As often as I've read them, something's wrong So hard to put my bony finger on Or perhaps it's really not as deep As I've been led to think Am I trying much too hard? Of course! I've been too close to see The answer's right in front of me Right in front of me It's simple, really, very clear Like music drifting in the air Invisible, but everywhere Just because I cannot see it Doesn't mean I can't believe it You know, I think this Christmas thing Is not as tricky as it seems And why should <i>they </i>have all the fun? It should belong to anyone Not anyone, in fact, but me Why, <i>I</i> could make a Christmas tree And there's no reason I can find I couldn't handle Christmas time I bet I could improve it, too And that's exactly what I'll do",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/jacks-obsession.html,0,0,something's up with jack something's up with jack don't know if we're ever going to get him back he's all alone up there locked away inside never says a word hope he hasn't died something's up with jack something's up with jack christmas time is buzzing in my skull will it let me be i cannot tell there are so many things i cannot grasp when i think i've got it and then at last through my bony fingers it does slip like a snowflake in a fiery grip something's here i'm not quite getting though i try i keep forgetting like a memory long since past here in an instant gone in a flash what does it mean what does it mean in these little bric-a-brac a secret's waiting to be cracked these dolls and toys confuse me so confound it all i love it though simple objects nothing more but something's hidden through a door though i do not have the key something's here i cannot see what does it mean what does it mean what does it mean i've read these christmas books so many times i know the stories and i know the rhymes i know the christmas carols all by heart my skull's so full it's tearing me apart as often as i've read them something's wrong so hard to put my bony finger on or perhaps it's really not as deep as i've been led to think am i trying much too hard of course i've been too close to see the answer's right in front of me right in front of me it's simple really very clear like music drifting in the air invisible but everywhere just because i cannot see it doesn't mean i can't believe it you know i think this christmas thing is not as tricky as it seems and why should they have all the fun it should belong to anyone not anyone in fact but me why i could make a christmas tree and there's no reason i can find i couldn't handle christmas time i bet i could improve it too and that's exactly what i'll do,something s up with jack something s up with jack don t know if we re ever going to get him back he s all alone up there locked away inside never says a word hope he hasn t died something s up with jack something s up with jack christmas time is buzzing in my skull will it let me be i cannot tell there are so many things i cannot grasp when i think i ve got it and then at last through my bony fingers it does slip like a snowflake in a fiery grip something s here i m not quite getting though i try i keep forgetting like a memory long since past here in an instant gone in a flash what does it mean what does it mean in these little bric a brac a secret s waiting to be cracked these dolls and toys confuse me so confound it all i love it though simple objects nothing more but something s hidden through a door though i do not have the key something s here i cannot see what does it mean what does it mean what does it mean i ve read these christmas books so many times i know the stories and i know the rhymes i know the christmas carols all by heart my skull s so full it s tearing me apart as often as i ve read them something s wrong so hard to put my bony finger on or perhaps it s really not as deep as i ve been led to think am i trying much too hard of course i ve been too close to see the answer s right in front of me right in front of me it s simple really very clear like music drifting in the air invisible but everywhere just because i cannot see it doesn t mean i can t believe it you know i think this christmas thing is not as tricky as it seems and why should they have all the fun it should belong to anyone not anyone in fact but me why i could make a christmas tree and there s no reason i can find i couldn t handle christmas time i bet i could improve it too and that s exactly what i ll do

The Nightmare Before Christmas,Town Meeting Song,"There were objects so peculiar They were not to be believed All around, things to tantalize my brain It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen And as hard as I try I can't seem to describe Like a most improbable dream But you must believe when I tell you this It's as real as my skull, and it does exist Here, let me show you This is a thing called a present The whole thing starts with a box A box? Is it steel? Are there locks? Is it filled with a pox? A pox, how delightful, a pox If you please... Just a box with bright-colored paper And the whole thing's topped with a bow A bow? But why? How ugly! What's in it? What's in it? That's the point of the thing, not to know It's a bat Will it bend? It's a rat Will it break? Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake? Listen now, you don't understand That's not the point of Christmas Land Now, pay attention We pick up an over-sized sock And hang it like this on the wall Oh, yes! Does it still have a foot? Let me see, let me look Is it rotted and covered with gook? Um, let me explain There's no foot inside, but there's candy Or sometimes it's filled with small toys Small toys? Do they bite? Do they snap? Or explode in a sack? Or perhaps they just spring out And scare girls and boys What a splendid idea! This Christmas sounds fun I fully endorse it Let's try it at once Everyone, please now, not so fast There's something here that you don't quite grasp Well, I may as well give them what they want And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last For the ruler of this Christmas Land Is a fearsome king with a deep, mighty voice Least that's what I've come to understand And I've also heard it told That he's something to behold Like a lobster, huge and red And he sets out to slay with his rain gear on Carting bulging sacks with his big, great arms That is, so I've heard it said And on a dark, cold night Under full moonlight He flies into a fog Like a vulture in the sky And they call him Sandy Claws Well, at least they're excited But they don't understand That special kind of feeling in Christmas Land Oh, well",http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/town-meeting-song.html,0,0,there were objects so peculiar they were not to be believed all around things to tantalize my brain it's a world unlike anything i've ever seen and as hard as i try i can't seem to describe like a most improbable dream but you must believe when i tell you this it's as real as my skull and it does exist here let me show you this is a thing called a present the whole thing starts with a box a box is it steel are there locks is it filled with a pox a pox how delightful a pox if you please just a box with bright-colored paper and the whole thing's topped with a bow a bow but why how ugly what's in it what's in it that's the point of the thing not to know it's a bat will it bend it's a rat will it break perhaps it's the head that i found in the lake listen now you don't understand that's not the point of christmas land now pay attention we pick up an over-sized sock and hang it like this on the wall oh yes does it still have a foot let me see let me look is it rotted and covered with gook um let me explain there's no foot inside but there's candy or sometimes it's filled with small toys small toys do they bite do they snap or explode in a sack or perhaps they just spring out and scare girls and boys what a splendid idea this christmas sounds fun i fully endorse it let's try it at once everyone please now not so fast there's something here that you don't quite grasp well i may as well give them what they want and the best i must confess i have saved for the last for the ruler of this christmas land is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice least that's what i've come to understand and i've also heard it told that he's something to behold like a lobster huge and red and he sets out to slay with his rain gear on carting bulging sacks with his big great arms that is so i've heard it said and on a dark cold night under full moonlight he flies into a fog like a vulture in the sky and they call him sandy claws well at least they're excited but they don't understand that special kind of feeling in christmas land oh well,there were objects so peculiar they were not to be believed all around things to tantalize my brain it s a world unlike anything i ve ever seen and as hard as i try i can t seem to describe like a most improbable dream but you must believe when i tell you this it s as real as my skull and it does exist here let me show you this is a thing called a present the whole thing starts with a box a box is it steel are there locks is it filled with a pox a pox how delightful a pox if you please just a box with bright colored paper and the whole thing s topped with a bow a bow but why how ugly what s in it what s in it that s the point of the thing not to know it s a bat will it bend it s a rat will it break perhaps it s the head that i found in the lake listen now you don t understand that s not the point of christmas land now pay attention we pick up an over sized sock and hang it like this on the wall oh yes does it still have a foot let me see let me look is it rotted and covered with gook um let me explain there s no foot inside but there s candy or sometimes it s filled with small toys small toys do they bite do they snap or explode in a sack or perhaps they just spring out and scare girls and boys what a splendid idea this christmas sounds fun i fully endorse it let s try it at once everyone please now not so fast there s something here that you don t quite grasp well i may as well give them what they want and the best i must confess i have saved for the last for the ruler of this christmas land is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice least that s what i ve come to understand and i ve also heard it told that he s something to behold like a lobster huge and red and he sets out to slay with his rain gear on carting bulging sacks with his big great arms that is so i ve heard it said and on a dark cold night under full moonlight he flies into a fog like a vulture in the sky and they call him sandy claws well at least they re excited but they don t understand that special kind of feeling in christmas land oh well
