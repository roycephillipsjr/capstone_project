Tarzan,Son Of Man Lyrics,"
                    Oh. the power to be strong
And the wisdom to be wise
All these things will come to you in time
On this journey that you're making
There'll be answers that you'll seek
And it's you who'll climb the mountain
It's you who'll reach the peak

Son of Man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of Man, a man in time you'll be

Though there's no one there to guide you
No one to take your hand
But with faith and understanding
You will journey from boy to man

Son of Man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of Man, a man in time you'll be

In learning you will teach
And in teaching you will learn
You'll find your place beside the ones you love
Oh, and all the things you dreamed of
The visions that you saw
Well, the time is drawing near now
It's yours to claim it all

Son of Man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of Man, a man in time you'll be

Son of Man
Son of Man's a man for all to see                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/d/disneys+tarzan/ + /d/disneys+tarzan/son+of+man_20587395.html

Show me everything and tell me how
It all means something
And yet nothing to me

It's all so close and yet so far
I see myself as people see me
Oh, I just know there's something bigger out there

I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

Every gesture, every move that she makes
Makes me feel like never before
Why do I have
This growing need to be beside her

Ooo, these emotions I never knew
Of some other world far beyond this place
Beyond the trees, above the clouds
I see before me a new horizon

Come with me now to see my world
Where there's beauty beyond your dreams
Can you feel the things I feel
Right now, with you
Take my hand
There's a world I need to know

I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

Two worlds, one family

A paradise untouched by man
Within this world blessed with love
A simple life, they live in peace

Softly tread the sand below your feet now

Beneath the shelter of the trees
Only love can enter here

Lift high the load
Take strength from those that need you
Build high the wall
Build strong the beams
A new life is waiting
But danger's no stranger here

No words describe a mother's tears
No words can heal a broken heart

Mulan,A Girl Worth Fighting For Lyrics,"

Been marching off to battle.

In our thundering herd,
We feel a lot like cattle.

Like the pounding beat
Our aching feet aren't easy to ignore

Hey! Think of instead,
A girl worth fighting for

Huh?

That's what I said,
A girl worth fighting for...
I want her paler than the moon,
With eyes that shine like stars

My girl will marvel at my strength,
Adore my battle scars.

I couldn't care less what she'll wear or what she looks like.
It all depends on what she cooks like.
Beef, pork, chicken.
Mmm

Bet the local girls thought you were quite the charmer.

And I'll bet the ladies love a man in armor.

You can guess what we
Have missed the most
Since we went off to war!
What do we want?
A girl worth fighting for.

My girl will think I have no faults.

That I'm a major find.

Uhh, How 'bout a girl who's got a brain,
Who always speaks her mind?

Nah!

My manly ways and turn of phrase are sure to thrill her!

He thinks he's such a lady killer.

I've a girl back home,
Who's unlike any other.

Yeah, the only girl who'd love him is his mother.

But when we come home in victory,
They'll line up at the door
What do we want?
A girl worth fighting for.
Wish that I had...
A girl worth fighting for.

To defeat the Huns.
Did they send me daughters
When I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I've ever met,
But you can bet before were through,
Mister I'll make a man out of you.

Tranquil as a forest,
But on fire within.
Once you find your center,
You are sure to win.
You're a spineless pale pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue.
Somehow I'll make a man out of you.

(Chan-Po)I'm never gonna catch my breath.

(Yow)Say goodbye to those who knew me.

(Ling)Why was I a fool in school for cutting gym?

(Mushu)This guy's got them scared to death!

With all the force of a great typhoon,

Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.

Time is racing toward us,
'Til the Huns arrive.

And you might survive.

So pack up, go home, you're through.

Mulan,Reflection Lyrics,"

I may never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter.
Can it be,
I'm not meant to play this part?
Now I see, that if I were truly to be myself,
I would break my family's heart.

Who is that girl I see, staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Somehow I cannot hide?
Who I am, though I've tried.
When will my reflection show, who I am, inside?
How I pray, that a time will come,
I can free myself, from their expectations
On that day, I'll discover someway to be myself,
and to make my family proud.
They want a docile lamb,
No-one knows who I am.
Must there be a secret me,
I'm forced to hide?
Must I pretend that I am someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside?                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/mulan/ + /m/mulan/reflection_20618814.html

Hercules,Go The Distance [Michael Bolton] Lyrics,"
                    I have often dreamed
Of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome
Would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer
When they see my face
And a voice keeps saying
This is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday
I can go the distance
I will find my way
If I can be strong
I know ev'ry mile
Will be worth my while
When I go the distance
I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road
To embrace my fate
Though that road may wander
It will lead me to you
And a thousand years
Would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime
But somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back
I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track
No, I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't lose hope
'Till I go the distance
And my journey is complete

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart

Like a shooting star
I will go the distance
I will search the world
I will face it's harms
I don't care how far
I can go the distance
'Till I find my hero's welcome
Waiting in your arms

I will search the world
I will face it's harms
'Till I find my hero's welcome

With blockeads just like you

Each and ev'ryone a disappointment
Pain for which there ain't no ointment
So much for excuses
Though a kid of Zeus' is
Asking me to jump into the fray
My answer is two words--
O. K.
You win
Oh gods
Oy vay!

A fellow who'd ring the bell for once--
Not the gong
The kind who wins trophies
Won't settle for low fees
At least semi pro fees, but no--
I get the greenhorn

I've been out to pasture pal, my ambition gone
Content to spend lazy days and to graze my lawn
But you need an advisor
A satyr, but wiser
A good merchandiser, and oohh!
There goes my ulcer!

I'm down to one last hope
And I hope it's you
Though, kid, you're not exactly a dream come true
I've trained enough turkeys
Who never came through
You're my one last hope so you'll have to do

Demigods have faced the odds
And ended up a mockery
Don't believe the stories
That you read on all the crockery

To be a true hero, kid, is a dying art
Like painting a masterpiece
It's a work of heart
It takes more than sinew
Comes down to what's in you
You have to continue to grow
Now that's more like it!

I'm down to one last shot
And my last high note
Before that blasted underworld
Gets my goat
My dreams are on you, kid
Go make 'em come true
Climb that uphill slope
Keep pushing that envelope
You're my one last hope

Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero just like that (snaps)

The girls went wild with
Oohs and aahs
And they slapped his face

Now nouveau riche and famous

What's a Grecian urn?

Say amen
There he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up
Just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs

Hercie, he comes
He sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were
Going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains, and spunk
From zero to hero a major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk

Who put the glad in gladiator?

Whose daring deeds are great theater?

Isn't he bold?
No one braver
Is he sweet

And you've been so many places; I guess it must be so
But still I cannot see, if the savage one is me
How can there be so much that you don't know?
You don't know...

You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name.

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle in a hoop that never ends

How high will a sycamore grow?
If you cut it down then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind

You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/p/pocahontas/ + /p/pocahontas/colors+of+the+wind_20465852.html

You can't step in the same river twice
The water's always changing, always flowing
But people, I guess, can't live like that
We all must pay a price
To be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing
What's around the riverbend
Waiting just around the riverbend

I look once more
Just around the riverbend
Beyond the shore
Where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for
What I dream the day might send
Just around the riverbend
For me
Coming for me

I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming
For a handsome sturdy husband
Who builds handsome sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming?
Just around the riverbend
Just around the riverbend

I look once more
Just around the riverbend
Beyond the shore
Somewhere past the sea
Don't know what for...
Why do all my dreams extend
Just around the riverbend?
Just around the riverbend...

Should I choose the smoothest course
Steady as the beating drum?
Should I marry Kocoum?
Is all my dreaming at an end?
Or do you still wait for me, Dream Giver

Pocahontas,Kleuren Van De Wind Lyrics,"
                    Ben ik een onwetende wilde?
Jij bevoer de hele wereld,
Je kijkt vast niet verkeerd.
Toch heb ik het idee,
Dat de wilde van ons twee
Degeen is die niet luistert en
Niet leert.
Die niet leert.

Jij denkt dat land
Waar jij belandt van jou is.
Jij plukt de aarde
Als een aarsgier kaal.
Maar ik weet
Elke rots
En boom,
Elk wezen
Heeft een ziel,
Heeft een leven,
Heeft een taal.

Jij noemt de mensen eigenlijk
Pas mensen als die mensen
Precies zo zijn als jij.
Maar treed eens in het voetspoor
Van een vreemde en dan
Leer je in een oogwenk zoveel bij.

Hoor je ooit de wolf een ode
Brengen aan de maan?
Of vraag jij ooit een lynx waarom
Hij spint?
Ben je doof voor alle stemmen
Van de bergen?
Ben je blind voor alle kleuren
Van de wind?
Ben je blind voor alle kleuren
Van de wind?

Kom rennen, laat je leiden door
De larix.
Het hert toont zijn betoverend domein.
Verover het en rol je door die rijkdom.
Maar vraag nooit what het waard
Zou kunnen zijn.

De regen, de rivier,
Het zijn mijn broeders.
De reiger en de otter,
Lucht en land.
En alles staat met alles
In verbinding.
In een cirkel,
Een oneindig groot verband.

Hoe hoog raakt de esdoorn
Ooit?
Wie de bomen rooit
Hoort het antwoord nooit.
Die hoort nooit de wolf een
Ode brengen aan de maan.
In wit of koper,
Ongeacht je tint.

Blijf niet doof voor alle stemmen
Van de bergen.
Blijf niet blind voor alle kleuren
Van de wind.
Wie de aarde zo begeert,
Vindt slechts aarde tot hij leert
Het te zien
In alle kleuren van
De wind.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/p/pocahontas/ + /p/pocahontas/kleuren+van+de+wind_20611934.html

When they see how I glitter!

Will be all a-twitter
The king will reward me
He'll knight me... No, lord me!

It's mine, mine, mind
For the taking
It's mine, boys
Mine me that gold!
With those nuggets dug...

It's glory they'll gimme
My dear friend, King Jimmy
Will probably build me a shrine
When all of the gold is mine

All of my life, I have searched for a land
Like this one
A wilder, more challenging country
I couldn't design
Hundreds of dangers await
And I don't plan to miss one
In a land I can claim
A land I can tame
The greatest adventure is mine!

Keep on working, lands
Don't be shirking, lands
Mine, boys, mind
Mine me that gold
Beautiful gold

Find a mother lode
Then find another load!
Dig! Dig! And diggety
Dig! Dig! For that gold
All
Make this island
My land!

Make the mounds big, boys
I'd help you to dig, boys
But I've got this crick in me spine

This land we behold...

This beauty untold...

A man can be bold!
It all can be sold!

And the gold
Is...
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!

So go for the gold
We know which is here
All the riches here
From this minute
This land and what's in it is
Mine!

Pocahontas,Pocahontas Lyrics,"
                    Aurora borealis
The icy sky at night
Our paddles break the water
In a long and hurried flight
From the white man and the fields of green
And the homeland we've never seen
They killed us in our tepee
They cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Cryin' on the ground
But the big guns and the wagon wheels come
Yes, and the night falls on the setting sun
They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little room at the top of the stairs
With an Indian rug and a pipe to share
I wish a was a trapper
I would give thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And to find out how she felt
In the morning on the fields of green
In the homeland we've never seen
Yes and maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
We'll sit and talk of Hollywood
And the good things there for hire
And the Astrodome and the first tepee
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me

There's silver rivers flow
And gold you pick right off a tree

When snow so deep 
The bears all sleep to keep themselves alive

They do what they must for now
And trust in their plan
If I trust in mine, somehow I might find who I am

So many voices ringing in my ear
Which is the voice that I was meant to hear?
How will I know?
Where do I go from here?

I've learned to choose
And even learned to say goodbye

The path ahead's so hard to see
It winds and bends but where it ends 
Depends on only me

In my heart I don't feel part of so much I've known
Now it seems it's time to start, 
A new life on my own

Lion King,Be Prepared Lyrics,"
                    I never thought hyenas essential
They're crude and unspeakably plain
But maybe they've a glimmer of potential
If allied to my visishiton and brain

I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are, pay attention
My words are a matter of pride

It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares

So prepare for a chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer

And where do we feature?

Just listen to teacher
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues!
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!

Yeah! Be prepared. We'll be prepared! For what?

For the death of the king

Is he sick?

No, fool! We're going to kill him. And Simba, too

Great idea! Who needs a king?

No king, no king! La la la la la!

Idiots! There will be a king!

But you said...

I will be king! Stick with me and you'll never go hungry again!

Yay, all right! Long live the king!
Long live the king!

It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored

Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!

So prepare for the coup of the century
Be prepared for the murkiest scamoooooo, la-la-la!
Meticulous planningwe'll have food!
Tenacity spanninglots of food
Decades of denialwe repeat
Is simply why I'llendless meat
Be king undisputed
Respected, saluted
And seen for the wonder I am

Lion King,Love Will Find A Way Lyrics,"

One we've never known
We would never need
To face the world alone
They can have the world
We'll create our own
I may not be brave or strong or smart
But somewhere in my secret heart I know

Love will find a way
Anywhere I go
I'm home, if you are there beside me
Like dark turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way

I was so afraid
Now I realize
Love is never wrong
And so it never dies
There's a perfect world
Shining in your eyes

And if only they could feel it too
The happiness I feel with you they'll know

Love will find a way
Anywhere we go
We're home
If we are there together
Like dark turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way

                    Zazu, why am I not loved?
I am that rare and awesome thing
I'm every inch a king
Yet I feel a twinge of doubt
As I go walk about

Hey, boss!

When my name is whispered through the pride
Is this talk of love or regicide?

Reggie who?

Tell me I'm adored
Please tell me I'm adored

Hey, boss!

Oh, what is it?

We got a bone to pick with you

There's no food, no water--

Yeah. It's dinnertime, and there ain't no
Stinkin' entrйes!

Oh, you and your petty complaints. You don't know what real hunger is.
Day after day it gnaws at the very core of my being

I had that once. It was worms

No, no, no... It's like an itch... Deep, persistent, profound...

That's it-- worms! When they get really bad all you gotta do is... Hunker
Down and scoot

Thanks for the tip. Ingrates! If it weren't for me you'd be beating off
Buzzards for your next bite!

Yeah, you're our savior, thanks a bunch
But how about some lunch?
It doesn't matter if it's fresh
I need a fix of flesh
My bones have moved to where they've never been
They are on the outside looking in

Are you blaming me?

Oh no, it's the lionesses

You are so adored
Oh, you are so adored

That's more like it

But what I'd give for one more hit
Of wildebeest kielbasa
Or maybe hornbill on the spit...

Oh, how I miss Mufasa

Mufasa?! Mufasa?! How dare you! I told you never to mention that name!

Note taken. I shall never mention ""M-m-m"" again

Even in death, his shadow looms over me
There he is!
No! There he is!
And there!

Calm yourself, Sire, or you'll get another one of your splitting
Headaches!

I am perfectly fine!
I'm better than Mufasa was
I'm revered
I am reviled
I'm idolized
I am despised
I'm keeping calm
I'm going wild!

I tell myself I'm fine
Yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am, no you're not
I tell myself I'm fine

No you're not, yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am
No you're not
Yes, no, yes, no, who am I talking to...?

Oh, pull yourself together, Sire!

Oh, very well. Zazu? Zazu, Zazu, Zazu...?

Yes, Sire?

Nobody loved me, there's the rub, not even as a cub
What did my brother have that I don't have?

Do you want the short list or the long?

Whatever!

Well, he had adoring subjects... A loving family... A devoted queen...

That's it! I need a queen!

A what?

A queen, man! A queen! Without a queen, what am I? A dead end, no line, no
Descendants, no future. With a queen, I'll have cubs... Immortality will
Be mine! Immortality will be mine!

Scar

Ah, Nala... Your timing couldn't have been more perfect. My how you've
Grown

Scar, you have got to do something. We're being forced to overhunt

She's got those assets feminine

You're the king. Control the hyenas

I have to make her mine

You're destroying the Pridelands

Nobility in every gene

If we don't stop now.. Don't you see...

She has to be my queen

... There's still a chance for things to be all right again...

Come, sweet Nala
It's written in the stars

What are you doing? Are you listening to me?

We'll create a host of little Scars

What are you talking about?

Tell me I'm adored

Get away from me

Tell me I'm adored
Oh, Nala... You know how I loathe violence... One way or another, you will
Be mine

Never, Scar. Never!

With due sense of decorum and with pride
With deference and great respect very much the norm
Plus a hint of sycophancy on the side
To lay before my ruler all the facts about his realm
To fill him in on all the beastly news

Yes, yes, Zazu, get on with it!

In order that His Majesty stands sturdy at the helm
Aware of all the fauna's latest views

Zazu! The morning report!

Er-- yes, Sire-- the morning report

Chimps are going ape, giraffes remain above it all
Elephants remember, though just what I can't recall
Crocodiles are snapping up fresh offers from the banks
Showed interest in my nest egg but I quickly said ""No thanks!""
We haven't paid the hornbills and the vultures have a hunch
Not everyone invited will be coming back for lunch

This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report

What are you doing, son?

Pouncing

Let and old pro show you how it's done

The buffalo have got a beef
About this season's grassstay low to the ground
Warthogs have been thwarted
In attempts to save their gas
Flamingoes in the pink andyeah, stay low!
Chasing secretary birds
Saffron is this season's color
Seen in all the herdsshh, not a sound
Moving down the rank and filetake it slow
To near the bottom rungone more step
Far too many beetles are
Quite frankly in the dungthen pounce!
Aaaaaak!

Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort

Aladdin,Are You In Or Out? Lyrics,"
                    Sa'luk:
I remember a time
When crime was sublime
There was plenty of loot in the lair
We'd plunder and pillage
And ransack a village
With nary a worry or care
Then along came this king
With his soft-hearted dream
But he ratted us out in the end
So rally the troops!
We were meant to re-group
And return to our roots once again!
Are you in or out?
Gotta know without a doubt
I'm the one you need for a dirty deed
I'm the best, success is guaranteed
Are you men or mice?
Take a slice of my advice!
You want a fearless leader, one that's strong and stout
Better vote for me
Are you in or out?

Thives:
We used to be smart, yes
Horrendously heartless
In ravaging raids, we were rough
We knew what we had
To be blissfully bad
Then Cassim brought this sensitive stuff!
And we strayed from the path
Of our rigorous wrath
Now we're taking a bath in the dust!
But we'll reclaim our winnings
Our humble beginnings
In turmoil and torture, we trust!

Sa'luk:
Are you in or out?
Double-crossers or devout?
Put your faith in me
Pretty soon you'll see
I'm the prince of generosity
Are you foe or friend?
Here's the path I recommend
You want a ride to fame?
I've got the fastest route;
What's it gonna be?
Thieves:
We'll go robbing in all the right places,
From Agrabah dunes to Bali
Imagine the fear on their faces
When we drop by for cookies and tea

Sa'luk:
Come along, boys!
Follow me!
Are you in or out?
If you're with me, give a shout (Yay!)
I'll lead you all the way
Into the glory days
We'll begin a life of crime that pays

                    Good pals, blood brothers
Me and three others
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

Four friends, none closer
Get mad? Heck no, sir!
Not us, four-strong, a permanent team

Four guys our poundin'
The pavements of Agrabah
Poor guys with one Alabian dream

To stay this lazy
And play like crazy
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

True friends, no phonies
Me and my cronies
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

Four bums, none better
Not one go-getter
Unmontivated in the extreme

Folks say, ""Hey, go earn a living in Baghdad
Grow up, go earn the city's esteem! ""
We say, ""Tough noogie!
No way! Let's boogie! ""
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

Four guys out making our music in Baghdad
In Baghdad we're the creme de la creme
Okay, supporters,
Clap hands, throw quarters,

Good pals, real chummy
Whozat? Guess dummy!
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

Old pals, none newer,
None tried, none truer
Eight eyes with one impertinent gleam

Four guys out passing the turban in Baghdad
For lettring off some musical stream
That's our finale

Aladdin,Father And Son Lyrics,"
                    It's a big bright beautiful future
Thank you your lucky stars, you're alive
You've got someone special to talk to
A friend that you can trust for life

You've been on your own with no family ties
But those solo days are done
You'll be two of a kind
Spending quality time
Together as father and son

Building model ships
Taking fishing trips
Warking hand in hand
Painting the palace and moving the sand
First ten to go, with your daddy-o
Once you break the ice
You can postulate palernal advice

It's a fine fantobulous future
I see fruitt on the family tree
You'll be great as the grumpy old grand-pa
Bouncing babies on your knee
You can fall asleep on the comfy couch
After playing one on one
Dreaming back to back
That you walloped the Shoq
Together as father and son

Maybe a bumpy ride
We'll make it side by side
Good afternoon, I'll be your travel guide
Moreover, Laddie, Make room for Daddy Gotta
Whole new shoulder to cry on

Take a chance now give it a spin
You've had chums for palin' around with
But you've never had a friend like him

Put your checkered past behind you now
No more living on the run
Face the big bright beautiul future

Aladdin,Forget About Love Lyrics,"

Forget about the way you fell into his eyes
Forget about his charms
Forget about how his handsomeness alarms
Walking on air's obnoxious
The thrill
The chill
Will make you nauseous
And you'll never get enough
Just forget about love!
Forget about romance
Forget about the way your heart begins to dance
Then you feel the blush
When he's spouting out some sentimental mush
Love really is revolting!
It's even worse than when you're sulking
Enough of this fluff!
Just forget about love!
[Jasmine:] I had almost forgotten the way it felt
When he held out his hand for mine
My heart all a-flutter
[Iago:] Oh, how I shudder
[Jasmine:] It was eternal bliss
[Iago:] It won't be missed!
Forget about 'is touch
[Jasmine:] I can't forget about his touch

It doesn't matter much
[Jasmine:] It matters so mu-uch

A meal becomes a banquet
When you eat alone

[Both:] Love's filled with compromises
[Iago:] And don't you hate those big surprises?

And I'll be there for you

Scheherezade had a thousand tales
But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeves
You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power in your corner now
Some heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how
See all you gotta do is rub that lamp

Mister Aladdin, sir
What will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order
Jot it down

And I'm your maitre d'

You ain't never had a friend like me

Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service

Say what you wish
It's yours! True dish
How about a little more Baklava?

Have some of column ""A""
Try all of column ""B""

Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this out their little hat?
Can your friends go, Woo?

Can your friends go, Abracadabra, let 'er rip
And then make the sucker disappear?

You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt
Well, all you gotta do is rub like so - and oh

Takes your hand

And lo, before you know
You grab your horse, you grab ur gear

Your banner high, your molars gnashing

Been playin' second fiddle,
And I don't get no respect

But this busted beak
Is the only thanks that I get!

They promise caviar,
And leave me eatin' dust!
That's some reward for loyalty
From here on in,
I'm lookin' out for me!
Oh, I don't need nobody else
I'll never fail
I'll cover my own tail
I can take care of myself!

You know, it just don't pay
To give a hoot

Just a con, need I go on?

Give me adequate cause
To send him packing on a one-way trip
So his prospects take a terminal dip
His assets frozen, the venue chosen

Seu camelo quer descansar

Pode vir e pular, no tapete voar
Noite Árabe vai chegar...

Aladdin,Nothing Like A Friend Lyrics,"
                    I parachuted down
Into the Taj Mahal
I rollerbladed
Along the great Great Wall!
I even made the famous
Leaning Tower fall,
But who was with me through it all?
Nobody!
The Moscow Circus
Hired me to fly trapeze
On Mount Olympus,
Ran a race with Hercules
It's easy when you're chased by killer bees!
Who said ""geshundheit"" when I sneezed? *Achoo*
So now I'm home,
Home again with you,
You chase the clouds away
Whenever I am blue

Aladdin:
(""You're always blue!"")

And though the pyramids,
I highly recommend
There is nothing in the world
Quite like a friend!
Slept like a babe in Bombay
On a bed of nails
Moroccans love my daring Dance of Seven Veils
Of seven veils
I single-handedly
I even saved the whales!
No one was there to hear my tales!
In Acapulco,
Joined a Mariachi band
I rode the ragin' rapids
Down the Rio Grande
Flew in a air balloon,
But when I tried to land
Nobody laughed,
Or lent a hand
Without you, the Amazon is
Just a trickle
Without you, the Sahara's
Not so hot
Without you, Niagara Falls
Is just a leaky faucet
The Huey ii
Is just some yacht
Now that I'm home,
Home again, it's clear,
All I ever wanted
Seems to be right here
I've traveled East and West
And now, I'm back again
There is nothing in the world
Quite like a friend...

Aladdin:
There's nothing in the world

Jasmine:
Nothing in the whole wide world

There is nothing in the world
Quite like a friend!

Down on one knee!

Brush up your sunday salaam

Mighty is he!

A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali

Purple peacocks
He's got fifty-three

When it comes to exotic-type mammals
Has he got a zoo?
I'm telling you, it's a world-class menagerie

Prince Ali! Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa
That physique! How can I speak
Weak at the knee
Well, get on out in that square
Adjust your vein and prepare
To gawk and gravel and stare at Prince Ali!

There's no question this Ali's alluring
Never ordinary, never boring
Everything about the man just plain impresses
He's a winner, he's a whiz, a wonder!
He's about to pull my heart asunder!
And I absolutely love the way he dresses!

He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys
(He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys)
And to view them he charges no fee
(He's generous, so generous)
He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies
(Proud to work for him)
They bow to his whim love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali!

Prince Ali!
Amorous he! Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see
And that, good people, is why he got dolled up and dropped by
With sixty elephants, llamas galore
With his bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key

Do something wilh your hair!

You mustn't wear an outfit that's naughty
A turban that's unravelling just won't do

And valets who will carefully park for you

Girls you look just lovely and so grown up too

Aladdin,You're Only Second Rate Lyrics,"

Your parlor tricks are amusing
I bet you've got a bunny
Under your hat!
Now here's your chance
To get the best of me,
Hope your hand is hot!
C'mon, clown,
Let's see what you've got!
You can try to slam me
With your hardest stuff
But your double whammy
Isn't up to snuff
I'll set the record straight
You're simply out of date
You're only second rate!
You think your cat's a meanine,
But your tiger's tame
You've got a lot to learn
About the genie game
So for your education,
I'll reiterate
You're only second rate!
Men cower at the power
In my pinky
My thumb is number one
On every list
But if you're not convinced
That I'm invincible,
Put me to the test!
I'd love to lay this rivalry to rest!
Go ahead and zap me
With the big surprise
Snap me in a trap,
Cut me down to size
I'll make a great escape
It's just a piece of cake
You're only second rate!
You know, your hocus-pocus
Isn't tough enough
And your mumbo-jumbo
Doesn't measure up
Let me pontificate
Upon your sorry state
You're only second rate!
Zaba-caba-dabra!
Granny's gonna grab ya!
Alakazam-da-mus
And this thing's bigger than the both of us!
So spare me your tremendous scare!
You look horrendous in your underwear!
And I can hardly wait
To discombobulate
I'll send ya back and packing
In a shipping crate
You'll make a better living
With a spinning plate
You're only second rate!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/a/aladdin/ + /a/aladdin/youre+only+second+rate_20657339.html

If I could give a gift to you
To hold to your heart dear
I'd give the Christmas memories
To hold throughout the year.

And when you have them all, I think
There's something more I'd bring
The gift of Christmas laughter now
So you could learn to sing...

La la la la, it's Christmas time
Memories everywhere
Singing of hope, peace to mankind
And love is in the air.

And every foolish notion leads to feelings that might start
To make the prayers the children pray
Come true in all our hearts...

Beast:
If you could give a gift to me
To hold to my soul dear
I'd love to see you smile upon my face,
Without a fear

And when you've smiled your fear away
There's something more you'd bring
The gift of gifts, remembering
How I first learned to sing...

Both:
La la la la, it's Christmas time
Memories everywhere

Don't look under the tree

Is something we can't see
Far more precious than silver
And more splendid than gold
Is something to treasure
But is something we can't hold

As long as there's Christmas
I truly believe
That hope is the greatest of the gifts
We'll receive (we'll receive)

As we all pray together
It's the time to rejoice
And though we may look different
We are singing with one voice

As Long As there's Christmas
I truly believe
That hope is the greatest of the gifts
We'll recieve

There is more (so much more)
To this time of year (to this time of year)
Than sleigh bells and holly
Mistletoes and snow
Those things will come and go
Come and goooo

As long as there is Christmas
I truly do believe that
Hope is the greatest of the gifts
We will receive (we'll receive)

Ma chere, Mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight.
And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents - your dinner!

Be our guest! Be our guest!
Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie
And we'll provide the rest
Soup du jour
Hot hors d'oeuvres
Why, we only live to serve
Try the gray stuff
It's delicious!

Don't believe me? Ask the dishes!
They can sing, they can dance
After all, Miss, this is France
And a dinner here is never second best
Go on, unfold your menu
Take a glance and then you'll
Be our guest
Oui, our guest

Beef ragout
Cheese souffle
Pie and pudding ""en flambe""

A culinary cabaret!

And you're scared
But the banquet's all prepared
No one's gloomy or complaining
While the flatware's entertaining
We tell jokes!
I do tricks
With my fellow candlesticks

And it's all in perfect taste
That you can bet
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass
To be out guest

For a servant who's not serving
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon
Ahh those good ol' days when we were useful
Suddenly those good ol' days are gone
10 years we've been rusting
Needing so much more than dusting
Needing exercise, a chance to use our skill
Most days we just lay around the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy you walked in and oopsie daisy

It's a guest! It's a guest!
Sakes alive, well I'll be blessed!
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed
With dessert, she'll want tea
And my dear that's fine with me
While the cups do their soft-shoein'
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing
I'll get warm, piping hot
Heaven's sakes! Is that a spot?
Clean it up! We want the company impressed

With your meal, with your ease

While the candlelight's still glowing
Let us help you,
We'll keep going
Course by course, one by one
'Til you shout, ""Enough! I'm done!""
Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up

Full of little people
Waking up to say:

TOWNSFOLK

Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!

There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Ev'ry morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town

BAKER

Good Morning, Belle!

Good morning, Monsieur.

BAKER

And where are you off to, today?

BELLE

I just finished the most wonderful story
About a beanstalk and an ogre and a -

Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

BOOKSELLER

BELLE

Thank you.
Thank you very much!

Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

BELLE

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my fav'rite part because --- you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

Now it's no wonder that her name means ""Beauty""
Her looks have got no parallel

I'm afraid she's rather odd

Ev'ryone's awed and inspired by you
And it's not very hard to see why

No one's slick as Gaston
No one's quick as Gaston
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston's
For there's no man in town half as manly
Perfect, a pure paragon!

Matches wits like Gaston

Ten points for Gaston!

When I was a lad
I ate four dozen eggs
Ev'ry morning to help me get large
And now that I'm grown

So I'm roughly the size of a barge!

Yes, I made the choice
For papa I will stay
But I don't deserve to lose my freedom in this way
You monster!

If you think that what you've done is right
Well then... you're a fool
Think again

Is this home?
Is this where I should learn to be happy?
Never dreamed
That a home could be
Dark and cold I was told
Every day in my childhood
Even when we grow old
Home will be where the heart is
Never were words so true
My heart's far, far away
Home is too.

Is this home?
Is this what I must learn to believe in?
Try to find something good
In this tragic place
Just in case
I should stay here forever
Held in this empty space
Oh, but that won't be easy
I know the reason why
My heart's far, far away
Home's a lie
What I'd give
To return
To the life that I knew lately
But I know that I can't
Solve my problems going back

Is this home?
Am I here for a day or forever?
Shut away from the world until
Who knows when
Oh but then
As my life has been altered once it can change again
Build higher walls around me
Change every lock and key
Nothing lasts, nothing holds all of me

Ah, cherie, won't it all be top-drawer
I'll wear lipstick and rouge
And I won't be so huge
Why, I'll easily fit through that door

I'll wear gowns!
I'll have hair!
It's my prayer to be human again

Only human again
When the world once more making sense
I'll unwind for a change

Lumiere

Really? That'd be strange!

Cogsworth

Can I help it if I'm t-t-tense?
In a shack by the sea
I'll sit back sipping tea
Let my early retirement commence
Far from fools made of wax
I'll get down to brass tacks and relax

All

When I'm human again
So sweep the dust from the floor!
Let's let some light in the room!
I can feel, I can tell
Someone might break the spell
Any day now!

Lumiere

Shine up the brass on the door!

Babette

Alert the dustpail and the broom!

All

If all goes as planned
Our time may be at hand
Any day now!

Mrs. Potts, egg timer, whisk

Open the shutters and let in some air

Mrs. Potts

Put these here and put those over there

All

Sweep up the years
Of sadness and tears
And throw them away!

Would you have dinner with me tonight?

Holiday' again

When we cast off this pall
We'll stand straight, we'll walk tall
When we're all that we were
Thanks to him, thanks to her
Coming closer and closer
And closer and...

We'll be dancing again!
We'll be twirling again!
We'll be whirling around with such ease
When we're human again
Only human again
We'll go waltzing those old one-two-threes
We'll be floating again!
We'll be gliding again!
Stepping, striding as fine as you please
Like a real human does
I'll be all that I was
On that glorious morn
When we're fin'lly reborn
And we're all of us human again!                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beauty+and+the+beast/ + /b/beauty+and+the+beast/human+again_20627055.html
Beauty and the Beast,If I Can't Love Her Lyrics,"
                    If I Can't Love Her

Beast:
And in my twisted face
There's not the slightest trace
Of anything that even hints of kindness
And from my tortured shape
No comfort, no escape
I see, but deep within is utter blindness

Hopeless
As my dream dies
As the time flies
Love a lost illusion
Helpless
Unforgiven
Cold and driven
To this sad conclusion

No beauty could move me
No goodness improve me
No power on earth, if I can't love her
No passion could reach me
No lesson could teach me
How I could have loved her and make her love me too
If I can't love her, then who?

Long ago I should have seen
All the things I could have been
Careless and unthinking, I moved onward

No pain could be deeper
No life could be cheaper
No point anymore, if I can't love her
No spirit could win me
No hope left within me
Hope I could have loved her and that she'd set me free
But it's not to be
If I can't love her
Let the world be done with me.                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beauty+and+the+beast/ + /b/beauty+and+the+beast/if+i+cant+love+her_20599831.html

You've been dreaming, just one dream
Nearly all your life
Hoping, scheming, just one theme:
Will you be a wife?
Will you be some he-man's property?
Good news!
That he-man's me!
This equation, girl plus man
Doesn't help just you
On occasion, women can
Have their uses too
Mainly to extend the fam'ly tree
Pumpkin, extend with me!

We'll be raising sons galore

Inconceivable!

Each built six foot four!

Unbelievable!

Ones play on the floor with the dogs. We'll have six or seven!

Dogs?

No, Belle!

Strapping boys... Like me!

Belle

Imagine that!

Gaston

I can see that we will share
All that love implies
We shall be a perfect pair
Rather like my thighs
You are face to face with destiny!
All roads lead to...
The best things in life are...
All's well that ends with me!
Escape me?
There's no way
Certain as ""Do, Re,""

Where did you get an idea like that?

Belle

I don't know.
It's just that, well, people talk.

Maurice

They talk about me, too.

Maurice

No, we're not odd, its true
No fam'ly ever saner
Except one uncle who... Well, maybe let that pass
In all you say or do
You couldn't make it plainer
You are your mother's daughter; therefore you are class

Belle

So I should just accept
I'm simply not like them

Maurice

They are the common herd
And you should take my word
You are unique: creme de la creme
No matter what you do
I'm on your side
And if my point of view Is somewhat misty-eyed
There's nothing clearer in my life
Than what I wish and feel for you
And that's a lot...
No matter what

No matter what they say
You make me proud I love the funny way
You stand out from the crowd

Shows the world out there one day

You are!

To praise him

We've come this far I pray that you remain
Exactly as you are
This really is a case of father knowing best

Beauty and the Beast,Prologue (The Enchantress) Lyrics,"
                    Once upon a time, in a faraway land,
A young Prince lived in a shining castle.
Although he had everything his heart desired,
The Prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind.
But then, one winter's night,
An old beggar woman came to the castle
And offered him a single rose In return for shelter from the bitter cold.
Repulsed by her haggard appearance,
The Prince sneered at the gift,
And turned the old woman away.
But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances,
For Beauty is found within.
And when he dismissed her again,
The old woman's ugliness melted away
To reveal a beautiful Enchantress.
The Prince tried to apologize, but it was too late,
For she had seen that there was no love in his heart.
And as punishment,
She transformed him into a hideous beast,
And placed a powerful spell on the castle,
And all who lived there.
Ashamed of his monstrous form,
The beast concealed himself inside his castle,
With a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.
The Rose she had offered,
Was truly an enchanted rose,
Which would bloom until his twenty-first year.
If he could learn to love another,
And earn her love in return
By the time the last petal fell,
Then the spell would be broken.
If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast
For all time.
As the years passed,
He fell into despair, and lost all hope,
For who could ever learn to love... A Beast?                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beauty+and+the+beast/ + /b/beauty+and+the+beast/prologue+the+enchantress_20623203.html

And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No it can't be

True that he's no Prince Charming

Neither one prepared

Ever a surprise

Bitter sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east

Beauty and the Beast,The Mob Song Lyrics,"
                    [Gaston:]       The Beast will make off with your children.
[Mob:]          {gasp}
[Gaston:]       He'll come after them in the night.
[Belle:]        No!
[Gaston:]       We're not safe till his head is mounted on my wall! I
Say we kill the Beast!
[Mob:]          Kill him!

[Man I:]        We're not safe until he's dead
[Man ii:]       He'll come stalking us at night
[Woman:]        Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
[Man iii:]      He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free
[Gaston:]       So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me

Through the mist
Through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer
Then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast
He's got fangs
Razor sharp ones
Massive paws
Killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar
See him foam
But we're not coming home
'Til he's dead
Good and dead
Kill the Beast!

[Belle:]        No! I won't let you do this!
[Gaston:]       If you're not with us, you're against us!
Bring the old man!
[Maurice:]      Get your hands off me!
[Gaston:]       We can't have them running off to warn the creature.
[Belle:]        Let us out!
[Gaston:]       We'll rid the village of this Beast. Who's with me?
[Mob:]          I am! I am! I am!)

Light your torch
Mount your horse
[Gaston:]       screw your courage to the sticking place
[Mob:]          We're counting on Gaston to lead the way
Through a mist
Through a wood
Where within a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see ev'ry day
It's a beast
One as tall as a mountain
We won't rest
'Til he's good and deceased
Sally forth
Tally ho
Grab your sword
Grab your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go!

[Gaston:]       We'll lay siege to the castle and bring back his head!
[Belle:]        I have to warn the Beast! This is all my fault! Oh, Papa,
What are we going to do?
[Maurice:]      Now, now, we'll think of something.

[Mob:]          We don't like
What we don't understand
In fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns
Bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the Beast!

[Cogsworth:]    I knew it! I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up.
[Lumiere:]      Maybe it would have been better if she had never come at all.
Could it be?
[Mrs Potts:]    Is it she?
[Lumiere:]      Sacre Bleu! Invaders!
[Cogsworth:]    Encroachers!
[Mrs Potts:]    And they have the mirror!
[Cogsworth:]    Warn the Master! If it's a fight they want, we'll be
Ready for them! Who's with me?
[Gaston:]       Take whatever booty you can find. But remember, the
Beast is mine!

[Objects:]      Hearts ablaze
Banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger just increased
[Mob:]          Raise the flag
Sing the song
Here we come, we're fifty strong
And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong
Let's kill the Beast!

[Mrs Potts:]    Pardon me, Master.
[Beast:]        Leave me in peace.
[Mrs Potts:]    But sir! The castle is under attack!

[Mob:]          Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast

[Lumiere:]      This isn't working!
[Featherduster:] Oh Lumiere, we must do something!
[Lumiere:]      Wait, I know!)

[Mob:]          Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

[Mrs Potts:]    What shall we do, Master?
[Beast:]        It doesn't matter now. Just let them come.

Dancing by the light of starfish a-glow
Dreaming I'm in love, it's so enchanting
At the mermaid's ball when I go dancing

Pretty mermaids wearing seaflowers
Of green and pink and blue
Whirling round and round in circles
With their partners two by two

As the grand orchestra plays
Romantic songs of yesterday
We will dance the night away

Relax your weary flippers

Little Mermaid,For A Moment Lyrics,"
                    Okay, get a grip, get a hang of this flipper
It's like slipping two feet into one big huge slipper.
This way is left which way is right
Oh, now I'll be circling in in circles all night

Oh, so this is forward. No problem.

I can't believe I can do this and more
To swim in the sea like I walk on the shore
Out of my shell, not closed up like a clam
look out sea, this is me, here I am

For a moment all of me
Is alive and at home in the sea
I'm swirling and twirling, so graceful and grand
Not stubbing my toes getting stuck in the sand

For a moment life is cool
I'm a splash in the world's biggest pool
This is more than my thoughts ever thought it could be
For a moment, just a moment, lucky me

If only for one moment
I have shared with you all I know
The sea wouldn't be a mystery
But why did you have to go?

Everything's newer, and brighter and bluer
And truer to life than before
Watch me soar

For a moment I can shine
Got a grin and a fin, it works fine
My fingers are wrinkly, I really don't care
If all my curls are curled out of my hair

For a moment I can feel
All the dreams I've been dreaming are real
Wish my mother could hear it, the sea is my song
For a moment, just a moment, I belong

I will find you my darling
And the moment that I do
I'll hold you close, my Melody
And sing the song of the sea with you

Sing the song of the sea with you
For a moment, just a moment, I belong                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/the+little+mermaid/ + /t/the+little+mermaid/for+a+moment_20627888.html

Right through my window a big world of water awaits
To have a sea at your fintips is such a special treat
I take a few steps out the back of my house for all the fun I need

In my blue backyard
It's open and wide and blue as the sky
In my blue backyard
There's no garden to hoe
No seaweeds to mow
Just fine fin friends who love to play
Dolphins to ride, bubbles to chase
Deep in the heart of my blue backyard

Whenever I'm swimming I know I won't see a fence
Out here there's no boundaries except for the continents
The seals and eels and humpbacks, the squid and pompaloo?
Are some of my pals who'll be hanging around so I won't be alone

In my blue backyard
It's open and wide and blue as the sky
In my blue backyard
There's no garden to hoe
No seaweeds to mow
Just fine fin friends who love to play
Dolphins to ride, bubbles to chase
Deep in the heart of my blue backyard

Sometimes I hide in the coral beds that's where I go to think
I don't have to be inside 'til the sun starts to sink

Watch a smile come shining through

He needs a friend today
He needs a little love
How can I turn away?

Then I pull out their bones

With a cleaver I hack them in two
I pull out what's inside
And I serve it up fried
God, I love little fishes, don't you?

Here's something for tempting the palette
Prepared in the classic technique
First you pound the fish flat with a malette
Then you slash off their skin
Give their belly a slice
Then you rub some salt in
'Cause it makes it taste nice

Zoot alors, I have missed one!

Sacre bleu, what is this?
How on earth could I miss
Such a sweet little succulent crab
Quel Domage, what a loss
Here we go, in the sauce
Now some flour I think just a dab
Now I stuff you with bread
It don't hurt, 'cause you're dead!
And you're certainly lucky you are
'Cause it's gonna be hot in my big silver pot!

Little Mermaid,Poor Unfortunate Souls Lyrics,"
                    URSULA
The only way to get what you want is
To become a human yourself.

ARIEL
Can you do that?

URSULA
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.
It's what I live for.
To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself.
Poor souls with no one else to turn to.

I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
True? Yes!
And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And here lately, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed (pathetic)

Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, ""Spells, Ursula, please!""
And I help them!
Yes I do

Now it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls

Have we got a deal?

ARIEL
If I become human,
I'll never be with my father or sisters again.

URSULA
That's right...
But you'll have your man, heh heh.
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it? Heh heh.
Oh, and there is one more thing.
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.
You can't get something for nothing, you know!

ARIEL
But I don't have any-

URSULA
I'm not asking much, just a token really, a trifle!
You'll never even miss it...
What I want from you is - your voice.

ARIEL
My voice?

URSULA
You've got it, Sweet-cakes, 
No more talking, singing, ZIP!

ARIEL
But without my voice, how can I-

URSULA
You'll have your looks, your pretty face!
And don't underestimate the importance of body language, ha!

The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore!
Yes on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word
And after all dear, what is idle prattle for?
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who get's her man

Come on you poor unfortunate soul,
Go ahead!
Make your choice!
I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
Ya' poor unfortunate soul
It's sad but true!
If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet,
You've got the pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her boys
The boss is on a roll
This poor unfortunate soul!

Beluga sevruga
Come winds of the Caspian Sea
Larengix glaucitis
Et max laryngitis
La volce to me

Now, sing!

ARIEL

Little Mermaid,Silence Is Golden Lyrics,"
                    You won't sing, you won't speak
Not a word, not a sqeak
Not a peep, not a squeal
That's the price, love, that's the deal

But silence, silence is golden my dear
Up there they hate chatter
So what does it matter
If you become mute (nobody likes a loudmouth!)

I mean it
Silence, silence is golden my dear
Don't you think you should try it
They'll say ""she's so quiet, so shy and so cute!""

Well, take it or leave it, that's all, that's the bargain
Go on, take a stand, make a choice
Remeber you'll get the legs and the lungs and the prince
All I get is the voice

And you'll be
Silent, but silence is golden, sign here
There's no choice for you since
You're in love with a prince
But relax, I've been told
Silence is gold                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/the+little+mermaid/ + /t/the+little+mermaid/silence+is+golden_20627870.html
Little Mermaid,Sing A New Song Lyrics,"
                    [ Simon ]
Why do all the flounder flee
Everytime they look at me?
Try, but I just don't fit in
I only make crustaceans cringe

Though I thought I had a smile worth sharing
I don't know why I scare the herring
I'm so lonely, sad and blue
What's a monster to do?

[ Ariel ]
You've got to sing
A happier song
It's time to change that same old tune
You've got to move on
Pick yourself up
Brush off your scales
Get that old tired
Whale of a tail
Tapping along
Sing a new song

So come out of your shell
And get into the swim
There's a wonderful world
Waiting for you to jump in

Just say goodbye to the dark and gloomy
Come outside where it's bright and roomy
Try your smile on someone new
And watch what it can do

You've got to sing

[ Simon ]
I've got to sing

[ Ariel ]
A happier song

[ Simon ]
A happier song

[ Ariel & Simon ]
It's time to change that same old tune

[ Ariel ]
You've got to move on

I've got to move on, yeah

Little Mermaid,The Sound Of Laughter Lyrics,"
                    Ariel, I'm so confused
I tell joke you're not amused
Given a choice I know you'll choose
The sound of laughter

All the creatures in the sea
Fish by fish they all agree
'Tis no sweeter harmony
Than the sound of laughter

Cos the giggle and chuckle and ha-ha-ha
Only make the fun come faster
Cos the giggle and chuckle and ha-ha-ha
Tis a phrase any mermaid can muster
That's the sound of laughter

Like the pounding ocean beat
It's the common tongue we speak
'Tis the rhythm that makes life complete
The sound of laughter

Stop the quiet undue peace
This serious stuff shall now cease
With the wonderful release
Of the sound of laughter

Cos the giggle and chuckle and ha-ha-ha
Only make the fun come faster
Cos the giggle and chuckle and ha-ha-ha
Tis a phrase any mermaid can muster
Oh, the sound of laughter

Cos the giggle and chuckle and ha-ha-ha
Only make the fun come faster
Cos the giggle and chuckle and ha-ha-ha
Tis a phrase any mermaid can muster
That's the sound of laughter                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/the+little+mermaid/ + /t/the+little+mermaid/the+sound+of+laughter_20627868.html
Little Mermaid,Tip And Dash Lyrics,"
                    Braving the tides, swarming the sea
Beware barracudas, drop to your knee
Defending our friends and enemies
As big as a whale but with a much smaller tail

Facing the foe with our fearless wit
Daring the dastards to put up their dukes
Great gobs of gore, we'll storm the shore
And seek the unknown, then can we go home?

Titanic Tip and Daring Dash
Adventurers slash explorers
Titanic Tip and Daring Dash
Adventurers slash explorers

We'll save the day and make a splash
Titanic Tip and Daring Dash

We'll clobber those crabs with their clammy claws
We'll sever those sharks with their savage jaws
The battle is fierce and mercifully brief
Because they're heroes they return as kings of the reef

Dine with the best, dressed with a flair
Climbed every mountain because it's there
Come on, follow me, we'll make history
To courage, to us, I'll try it, you're bust!

Titanic Tip and Daring Dash
Adventurers slash explorers
Titanic Tip and Daring Dash

We'll save the day and make a splash

Little Mermaid,Under The Sea Lyrics,"
                    The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?

Under the sea, under the sea
Darling it's better down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we're devoting full time to floating
Under the sea, ha ha...

Down here all the fish is happy
And soft through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad 'cause they in the bowl!
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who goin' be on the plate?

Wo-no, under the sea
Under the sea
Nobody beat us, fry us and eat us
In frickazee
We what the land folks loves to cook
Under the sea we off the hook
We've got no troubles, life is the bubbles
Under the sea (under the sea)
Under the sea (under the sea)
Since life is sweet here, we got the beat here
Naturally (naturally-ee-ee-ee)
Even the sturgeon and the ray
They get the urge and start to play
We've got the spirit, you've got to hear it
Under the sea

The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass and they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul (yeah)
The ray, he can play the Ling's on the strings
The trout rockin out
The blackfish she sings
The Stout and the Sprat
They know where it's at
They know that blowfish blow!

Yeah, under the sea
Under the sea
When the sardine begin to beguine
It's music to me (music is to me)
What do they got, a lot of sand?
We've got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here know how to jam here
Under the sea
Each little slug here cutting a rug here
Under the sea
Each little snail know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter under the water
Yeah, we in luck here down in the muck here

Little Mermaid,Where Mermaids Dwell Lyrics,"
                    [ Ariel ]

Well dear friend, it's time to put this letter into a bottle. And hope the ocean current brings it back to you. Maybe soon you'll come to visit me, even if only in your dreams. Just follow the mermaid song and you'll find me. Til then, your friend, Ariel.

[ Mermaids ]

Come to the place where mermaids dwell
Follow the call of trumpet shells
We'll fill your sails with friendly winds
And point the way with shining fins
And you can bid your cares farewell

Come to the place where mermaids dwell
In dreams you know the way so well
For if you hope and you believe
You'll see the golden nets we weave
You'll hear the stories that we tell
Where mermaids dwell
(Where mermaids dwell)
Where mermaids dwell
(Where mermaids dwell)

There are dolphins to ride for pleasure
And starfish that twinkle all night long
Streams of pearls and sunken treasure
And a mermaid song

Come to the place where mermaids dwell
Where shimmering ocean waters swell
Where laughing children of the waves
Play hide and seek among the caves
And ride a seahorse carousel

Come to the place where mermaids dwell
(Come to the place where mermaids dwell)
In dreams you know the way so well
For if you hope and you believe
You'll see the golden nets we weave
You'll hear the magic in our spell
Where mermaids dwell
(Where mermaids dwell)
Where mermaids dwell
(Where mermaids dwell)
Where mermaids dwell

Little Mermaid,You Got To Be You Lyrics,"
                    When I was but a schoolboy
I dreamed I would grow tall
And man, it made me crabby
That a crab could be so small

With this I tell my teacher
She say, ""But don't you see?
Each and every creature
Is exactly how they should be""

She said we all are special
From jellyfish to king
We all do different things
And with that she start to sing

You got to be you
I got to be me
It's simple but true
What else could you do
Who else could you be

You got your own style
Now let it come through
And remember no matter what
You got to be you

Skatefish got to skate
Stingrays got to sting
Catfish got to purr
And Sebastian got to sing
Seahorse got to ride
Flounder got to play
And whale got to make the trouble
All the livelong say

So why should you be gloomy
That you're too big or small
The sea is very roomy
And there's plenty room for us all

You heard my little story
Now let it be your guide
Just treat yourself with pride
You'll be more than satisfied

You got to be you
I got to be me
I'll try to be clearer
Look in the mirror
What do you see?

You see what I mean
Now let us review

Let's see now...
Some may be tiny
Some got the claws
Gills may be shiny
Sharks got the jaws
Down in the briny
Those are the laws
And that is why we sing

You got to be you
I got to be me
It's simple but true
What else could you do
Who else could you be

You got your own style
Now let it come through
And remember no matter what
You got to be you

You got your own voice
You've got to rejoice
You got to be you
Don't be so blue                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/the+little+mermaid/ + /t/the+little+mermaid/you+got+to+be+you_20627863.html
Little Mermaid,You Wouldn't Want To Mess With Me Lyrics,"
                    With one wave of my hand
You know who's in command
I'm the quintessential queen of sorcery
I keep a potion in my purse
That's worse than any curse
No, you wouldn't want to mess with me

Take a barracuda's nose
And a dozen turtle toes
And the venom of a sea anemone
Eye of urchin, Crab of louie
Stir the goop until it's goey
That's my favourite rancid recipe
No, you wouldn't want to mess with me

::: Later:::

Make way, I'm in charge
Your fate is looming large
It won't do you any good to flee
My concoctions never fail
So you'd better watch your tail
No, you wouldn't want to mess with me

When you think I'm on the brink of going under
I've a way of coming out on top
Oh my darling debutante
I always get just want I want
And I want this mucky luck to stop!

I'm the mistress of mystique
With a slender slim physique
I'm an idol in the sea of infamy
I admit I'm quite a catch
But I've never met my match

So you shouldn't test the best
'Cause you couldn't stand the stress
No, you wouldn't want to mess with me                ",https://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/the+little+mermaid/ + /t/the+little+mermaid/you+wouldnt+want+to+mess+with+me_20627862.html
