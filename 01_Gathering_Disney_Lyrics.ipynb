I've got that wanderlust Gotta walk the scene Gotta kick up highway dust Feel the grass that's green Gotta strut them city streets Showin' off my eclat, yeah Tellin' my friends of the social elite Or some cute cat I happen to meet That I'm Abraham DeLacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley O'Malley, the alley cat! I'm king of the highway Prince of the boulevard Duke of the avant garde The world is my backyard So if you're goin' my way That's the road you wanna seek Calcutta to Rome or Home-sweet-home in Paris Magnifique, you all I only got myself And this big old world But I sip that cup of life With my fingers curled I don't worry what road to take I don't have to think of that Whatever I take is the road I make It's the road of life make no mistake, for me Yeah, Abraham DeLacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley O'Malley, the alley cat! That's right And I'm very proud of that Yeah!\",\n",
